   An \udefine{order} on a set $S$, typically denoted as $<$, is
   a binary relation satisfying:
   \begin{enumerate}
      \item $\forall x, y \in S$, exactly one of the following is true:
      \begin{itemize}
         \item $x<y$ \item $x=y$ \item $y<x$
      \end{itemize}

      \item given $x, y, z \in S$, we have that $x<y<z\Rightarrow x<z$
   \end{enumerate}
   \hfill \bigbreak

   As a shorthand, we will specify that
   \begin{itemize}
      \item $x>y \Leftrightarrow y<x$
      \item $x\leq y \Leftrightarrow x<y \text{ or } x=y$
      \item $x\geq y \Leftrightarrow x>y \text{ or } x=y$
   \end{itemize}

   An \udefine{ordered set} is a set with a specified ordering. Let
   $S$ be an ordered set and $E$ be a nonempty subset of $S$. 

   \hTwoOld

   \begin{itemize}
      \item If $b \in S$ has the property that $\forall x \in E, \hspace{0.25em}
      x \leq b$, then we call $b$ an\\ \udefine{upperbound} to $E$ and 
      say that $E$ is \udefine{bounded above} by $b$.
      \hfill \bigbreak
      
      \item if $b \in S$ has the property that $\forall x \in E, 
      \hspace{0.25em} x \geq b$, then we call $b$ an 
      \udefine{lower bound} to $E$ and say that $E$ is 
      \udefine{bounded below} by $b$.
      \hfill \bigbreak
   
      \item We call $\beta \in S$ the \udefine{least upperbound} to $E$ if
      $\beta$ is an upper bound to $E$ and $\beta$ is the least of all
      upperbounds to $E$. In this case, we also commonly call $\beta$ 
      the \udefine{supremum} of $E$ and denote it as $\sup{E}$.
      \hfill \bigbreak
   
      \item We call $\beta \in S$ the \udefine{greatest lower bound} to $E$ if
      $\beta$ is an lower bound to $E$ and $\beta$ is the greatest of all
      lower bounds to $E$. In this case, we also commonly call $\beta$ 
      the \udefine{infimum} of $E$ and denote it as $\inf{E}$.
      \hfill \bigbreak

      \item We call $e \in E$ the \udefine{maximum} of E if $\forall 
      x \in E, \hspace{0.25em} x \leq e$
      \hfill \bigbreak

      \item We call $e \in E$ the \udefine{minimum} of E if $\forall

   \uuline{Fact}: For an ordered set $S$ and nonempty $E\subseteq S$,
   either:
   \begin{itemize}
      \item neither $\max{E}$ nor $\sup{E}$ exists
      \item $\sup{E}$ exists but $\max{E}$ does not exist
      \item $\max{E}$ exists and $\sup{E}=\max{E}$
   \end{itemize}

   \pagebreak
   \exOne
   Using $\mathbb{Q}$ as our ordered set...
   \begin{itemize}
      \item For $E = \{q \in \mathbb{Q} \mid 0<q<1\}$,
      $\max{E}$ does not exist but $\sup{E}$ exists and equals $1$.
      \exP
      \begin{myIndent}
         To understand why, note that the set of all upper bounds
         of $E$ is equal to\\ $\{q \in \mathbb{Q} \mid q \geq 1\}$ and 
         $1$ is obviously the smallest element of that set. Thus, $1$
         is the supremum of $E$. However, $1 \notin E$. Thus, if
         $\max{E}$ did exist, it would have to not equal $1$. But that
         would contradict $1$ being the least greatest bound.
      \end{myIndent}
      \hfill \bigbreak

      \exOne
      \item For $E = \{q \in \mathbb{Q} \mid 0<q \leq 1\}$,
      $\max{E}$ and $\sup{E}$ exist and they both are equal to $1$
      \exP
      \begin{myIndent}
         The reasoning for this is similar to that for the previous set.
      \end{myIndent}
      \hfill \bigbreak
      
      \exOne
      \item For $E = \{q \in \mathbb{Q} \mid q^2 < 2\}$, neither
      $\max{E}$ and $\sup{E}$ exist.
      \exP
      \begin{myIndent}
         To prove this, we can show there exists a function $f:
         \mathbb{Q}^+\rightarrow\mathbb{Q}^+$ such that
         $\forall q \in \mathbb{Q}^+$,\\ $q^2 < 2
         \Rightarrow q^2 < (f(q))^2 < 2$ and $2 < q^2
         \Rightarrow 2 < (f(q))^2 < q^2$. That way we can give
         a counter example to any possible claimed supremum or 
         maximum of $E$.
         \hfill \bigbreak


         Now instead of being like Rudin and simply providing the desired
         function, I want to present how one may come up with a function 
         that works for this proof themselves.
         \hfill \bigbreak

         Firstly, note that for the following reasons, we know our 
         desired function must be a rational function:
         \begin{itemize}
            \item[$\diamond$] $\forall q \in \mathbb{Q}, \hspace{0.25em} 
            f(q) \in \mathbb{Q}$. Based on this, we can't use any radicals,
            trig functions, logarithms, or exponentials in our desired
            function. \hfill \bigbreak

            \item[$\diamond$] $q^2 > 2 \Rightarrow f(q) < q$. In other
            words, $f$ needs to grow slower than a linear function. Thus,
            we can rule out the possibility of $f$ being a polynomial.
            \hfill \bigbreak

            \item[$\diamond$] If we wanted $f$ to be a linear function,
            it would have to have the form\\ $f(q) = \alpha(q - \sqrt{2})
            + \sqrt{2}$ where $\alpha$ is some constant. This is
            because when $q^2 = 2, \hspace{0.25em} f(q) = q$. However, there
            is no value one can set $\alpha$ to which both eliminates the
            presence of irrational numbers in that function while
            simultaneously making $f(q) \neq q$ when $q^2 \neq 2$. So
            no linear function can possibly work for this proof.
            \hfill \bigbreak
         \end{itemize}

         Having narrowed our search, let's now pick some convenient
         properties we would wish our proof function to have. Specifically,
         let's force $f$ to be constantly increasing, have a $y$-intercept
         of $1$, and approach a horizontal asymptote of $y = 2$. Doing this,
         we can now say that an acceptable function will have the following
         form where $\alpha$ is an unknown constant:
         \[f(q) = 1 + \frac{q}{q + \alpha}\]
         
         And finally, we can solve for $\alpha$ using the following system
         of equations:
         \[\begin{matrix}
            (1 + \frac{q}{q + \alpha})^2 = 2 \\
            \\
            1 + \frac{q}{q + \alpha} = q
         \end{matrix}\]

         Now here's where a graphing calculator like Desmos can be very
         useful. Instead of painstakely having to solve for $\alpha$,
         we can use a graphing calculator to approximate the value of
         $\alpha$ that satisfies our system of equations.
         \begin{center}
         \includegraphics[scale=0.75]{Finding_Equation_Demonstration_1.png}
         \end{center}

         Based on the graph above, it looks like $f(q) = 1 +
         \frac{q}{q + 2}$ will work for our proof. And sure enough 
         it does. Furthermore, we can verify that the function we came
         up with is equivalent to that which Rudin presents.

      Proposition \propCount: $S$ has the least upperbound property if
      and only if $S$ has the greatest lower bound property.
      
      \hThreeOld
      \begin{myIndent}
         Proof: Let's say we have an ordered set $S$
         \hfill \bigbreak

         Assume $S$ has the least upperbound property. Then, let
         $B \subseteq S$ be a nonempty subset which is bounded below.
         Additionally, let $A \subseteq S$ be the set of all lower bounds
         of $B$. \newpage
         
         \begin{myIndent}
            We know that $A \neq \emptyset$ because we assumed that $B$ is
            bounded below. Thus, at least one lower bound to $B$ exists and
            belongs to $A$. \\Additionally, because we assumed $B$ is nonempty,
            we can say that each $b \in B$ is an upper bound to $A$. Thus, $A$
            is bounded above. Because of these two facts, we can apply the
            greatest lower bound property to say that the supremum of $A$ 
            exists. \hfill \bigbreak
   
            Let's define $\alpha \coloneq \sup{A}$. With that, our goal is 
            now to show that\\ $\alpha = \inf{B}$. To do this, we need to 
            show firstly that $\alpha$ is a lower bound to $B$ and 
            secondly that it is greater than all other lower bounds of $B$.
            \retTwo
            \begin{enumerate}
               \item For each $b \in B$, we have that $b$ is an 
                  upperbound to $A$. And since $\alpha = \sup{A}$ is the
                  least upperbound to $A$, we must have that $\alpha \leq
                  b$. Thus $\alpha$ is a lower bound to $B$. \retTwo
               
               \item If $x \in S$ is a lower bound to $B$, then $x \in A$.
                  And since\\ $\alpha = \sup{A}$, $x \leq \alpha$. This shows
                  that $\alpha$ is greater than or equal to all other lower
                  bounds. \retTwo
            \end{enumerate}
            
            Hence, $\alpha$ is the infimum of $B$. And since we did this
            for a general $B \subseteq S$, we can thus say that $S$ has
            the greatest lower bound property. \retTwo
         \end{myIndent}

         Now we skipped doing the reverse direction proof because it
         is almost completely identical to the foward direction proof.
         However, just know that the above proposition is an
         \uuline{if and only if} statement. $\blacksquare$

   An \udefine{ordered field} is a field $F$ equipped with an ordering

      Proposition \propCount.\subPropCount: If $x\in\mathbb{R}$, $y\in\mathbb{R}$, and $x>0$, then there is a positive integer $n$ such that $nx>y$. This is called the \udefine{archimedean property}.

      {\begin{myIndent} \hThree
         Proof: We proceed by looking for a contradiction. Let $A=\{nx \mid n\in\mathbb{Z}^+\}$ and assume $\nexists n\in\mathbb{Z}^+$ such that $nx>y$. In that case we know $y$ is an \\upper bound of $A$. Additionally, since $A$ is bounded above, we know by the least upper bound property of the real numbers that $\sup{A}$ exists. So, let $\alpha=\sup{A}$. \retTwo

         Now because $\mathbb{R}$ is an ordered field, we know that: \\
         $x>0 \Rightarrow -x<0 \Rightarrow \alpha-x<\alpha$. Therefore, because $\alpha$ is the least upper bound, we know that $\alpha - x$ is not an upper bound for $A$. Or in other words, there exists $n\in\mathbb{Z}^+$ such that $nx>\alpha-x$. But this contradicts that $\alpha$ is the least upper bound of $A$ because $nx>\alpha-x \Rightarrow (n+1)x>\alpha$ and $(n+1)x\in A$. So we conclude that the supremum of $A$ can't exist, which by the contrapositive of the least upper bound property, means that $A$ is not bounded above.
         \retTwo
      \end{myIndent}}

      Proposition \propCount[0].\subPropCount: If $x, y\in\mathbb{R}$ and $x<y$, then there exists a $p\in\mathbb{Q}$ such that $x<p<y$. In other words, we say that $Q$ is \udefine{dense} in $R$.

      {\begin{myIndent} \hThree
         Proof: Since $x<y$, we have that $0<y-x$. Then because $y-x$ is positive, we can use the archimedean property to say that there exists an integer $n$ such that $n(y-x)>1$. Note for later that this means $ny>1+nx$.

         \newpage

         Now note that since $1>0$ and $nx$ is a real number, we can use the archimedean property twice to get positive integers $m_1$ and $m_2$ such that $m_1\cdot1>-nx$ and $m_2\cdot1>+nx$. Thus, we get the expression $-m_1 < nx < m_2$ which can be rewritten as $0 < nx + m_1 < m_1 + m_2$. Next, because the set of \\positive integers is well ordered, meaning every nonempty subset of them has a least element, and $m_1+m_2$ belongs to the set of positive integers greater than $nx + m_1$, we know there exists some least positive integer greater than $nx + m_1$. Or in other words, there exists $m^\prime$ such that $m^\prime - 1 \leq nx + m_1 < m^\prime$. This then leads us to conclude that there is an integer $m=m^\prime-m_1$ such that $m - 1 \leq nx < m$. \retTwo

         We now combine inequalities as follows: $m-1 \leq nx \Rightarrow m \leq nx+1$. So we have that $nx < m \leq nx+1$. But now remember from the previous page that $ny>1+nx$. So we can say that $nx < m \leq nx+1 < ny$. Finally, because $n>0$, we can multiply the inequality by $\frac{1}{n}$ to get that $x<\frac{m}{n}<y$. $\blacksquare$
