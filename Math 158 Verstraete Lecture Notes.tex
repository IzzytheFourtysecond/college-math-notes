   A \udefine{graph} is a pair $(V, E)$ where $V$ is a set of vertices
   and $E$ is a set of unordered pairs of elements of $V$ called edges.
   For $u, v \in V$, we say $u$ and $v$ are \udefine{adjacent} if 
   $\{u, v\} \in E$.

If $G = (V, E)$ and $v \in V$, the \udefine{neighborhood} of $v$ is
$N_{G}(v)=\{w \in V \mid \{v, w\} \in E\}$. \bigbreak

The \udefine{degree} of $v$ is $d_{G}(v) = \lvert N_{G}(v) \rvert$.
Or in other words, $v$'s degree is equal to the number of edges 
connecting to $v$.

   The \udefine{Handshaking lemma} states that for any graph $(V, E)$:
      {\fontsize{16}{15}\selectfont
      \[ \sum_{v \in V} d_{G}(v) = 2 \lvert E \rvert \]}
   
   \hThreeOld
   \begin{myIndent}
      The reason for this is that each edge increments the degrees of
      exactly two vertices. So the above sum counts every edge twice.

   \uuline{Lemma}: Every graph has an even number of vertices with odd
   degrees.

   \hThreeOld
   \begin{myIndent}
      Proof: We can split the vertices of any graph into two categories:
      those with odd degrees, and those with even degrees.
      \hfill \bigbreak
      Now recall that an even number plus an even number always equals
      an even number, as does an odd number plus an odd number. However,
      an odd\\ number plus an even numbers equals an odd number. Based on
      this fact, we can guarentee that the sum of even degrees in any
      graph is even. And since the sum of even degrees plus the sum of 
      odd degrees must be even as it equals $2 \lvert E \rvert$ by
      the Handshaking lemma, we thus know that the sum of odd degrees 
      must be even. Hence, it must be the case that there are an even 
      number of vertices with odd degree because otherwise the sum of 
      their degrees won't be even.

   A graph is called \udefine{$r$-regular} if all of its vertices have
   degree $r$.

   An $r$-dimensional \udefine{cube graph}, denoted as $\mathrm{Q}_{r}$,
   is a graph such that $V(\mathrm{Q}_{r})$, the set of vertices in 
   $\mathrm{Q}_{r}$, is equal to the set of binary strings of 
   length $r$; and $E(\mathrm{Q}_{r})$, the set of edges in 
   $\mathrm{Q}_{r}$, is equal to the set of pairs of binary strings
   which differ in only one position.

An \udefine{induced subgraph} of $G = (V, E)$ is a subgraph

Alternatively, this is called the subgraph induced by $X$.

Given $G = (V, E)$ and $F \subseteq E$, the

   \uuline{Lemma (part 1)}: If $G = (V, E)$ is a graph of minimum degree
   $k \geq 2$, then $G$ contains a cycle of length at least
   $k + 1$.

   {\exPOldd \begin{myConstrict}
      Proof: Let $P$ be a longest possible path in $G$, say:
      \[V(P) = \{v_1, v_2, \ldots, v_r\}\]

      Then $N(v_r) \subseteq V(P)$. After all, if this were not 
      the case, we'd be able to extend the path to the vertex in 
      $N(v_r)$ but not in $V(P)$, thus contradicting the fact that
      $P$ is a longest path. \retTwo

      Let $v_i$ be the first neighbor of $v_r$ along the path from
      $v_1$ to $v_r$. Then $\{v_i, v_{i+1}, \ldots, v_r\}$ are the
      vertices of a cycle $C$. \retTwo

      Now note that because $N(v_r) \subseteq P$ and $v_i$ was
      the first element in the path $P$ to belong to $N(v_r)$, 
      we know that $C$ contains all the elements of $P$ that 
      $N(v_r)$ also has. So, $N(v_r) \subseteq C$. \retTwo

      But now note that $\lvert N(v_r) \rvert \geq \delta(G)=k$. Plus,
      $v_r$ itself is not in $N(v_r)$. Combining these facts together,
      we can say that the cycle $C$ has at least $k + 1$ vertices.
   \end{myConstrict}}

   \uuline{Lemma (part 2)}: The cycle length $k+1$ is the longest 
   we can guarentee based on the minimum degree of the graph being $k$.

      Proof: Take the graph $K_{k+1}$ which has a minimum degree $k$.

      Obviously, the longest cycle in $K_{k+1}$ is the cycle containing
      all $k+1$ elements of $K_{k+1}$. Thus, we have shown that there

      length greater than \newline $k + 1$.

            Proof: We shall proceed by induction. \retTwo
            
            If $n = 1$, the tree is $K_1$, meaning that it has $0=n-1$
            edges. \retTwo

            Now assume the lemma is true for all trees with $n$
            vertices, and let $T$ be a tree with $n+1$ vertices. Then,
            we shall remove a vertex $v$ of $T$ with degree $1$. 
            (Note that we know such a vertex must exist since 
            otherwise the minimum degree of $T$ would be 
            at least $2$ and that would guarentee a cycle exists 
            of at least length 3. This
            of course contradicts the fact that $T$ is acyclic.)
            \retTwo 
            Then $T - \{v\}$ is a tree with $n$ vertices as it must be acyclic and connected. 
            So by induction it has $n-1$ edges. And because
            $v$ has degree $1$, we know that \newline $\lvert E(T) \rvert

            So, we can now go back to the top of the proof and ask:
            does $G -\{e\}$ have any cycles? We can repeatedly do this
            until the graph has no cycles since taking away edges
            does not remove any vertices.

Let $d_G(u, v)$ be the distance between $u$ and $v$.\retTwo

Distance is a \udefine{metric}, meaning:
\begin{myIndent}\begin{myIndent}\begin{enumerate}
   \item $d_G(u, v)=0 \Longleftrightarrow u=v$
   \item $d_G(u, v)=d_G(v, u)$

      d_G(u, v) \leq d_G(u, w) + d_G(w, v)$

The \udefine{diameter} of a connected graph $G$ is the maximum distance
between any two vertices of $G$. Or in other words,
$\max\{d_G(u,v) \mid u,v\in  V(G)\}$. \retTwo

The \udefine{radius} of $G$ is equal to 
   $ \min\{\max\{d_g(u,v) \mid u\in V(G)\} \mid v\in V(G)\} $. What
   that means is that the radius of $G$ measures the smallest distance
   path one could limit themselves to drawing while still being able
   to have that path have one end at some fixed vertex and its other
   end at any arbitrary vertex in the graph.


\begin{myIndent}

      \item The radius of $K_n$  is $1$. The diameter of $K_n$ is $n$.

      \item The diameter of $P_k$ is $k$. The radius, can be computed as
         follows:
         \begin{myIndent} \hFourOldd
            The middle vertex of a path will have the fastest access
            to either end of the path. So, we shall measure the radius
            from the vertex: $v_{\lceil \frac{k+1}{2} \rceil}$. Then,
            we can see that $v_{k+1}$ is going to be a farthest element
            from $v_{\lceil \frac{k+1}{2} \rceil}$. So the radius
            of $P_k$ equals $k + \lceil \frac{k+1}{2} \rceil$.
            \retTwo

            Now you can consider what happens when $k$ is even and odd.
            But what's \\important is that it works out that the radius
            is $\lceil \frac{k}{2} \rceil$.

      Here's how to find a spanning tree in a connected graph with a root
      vertex $v$ such that the tree "preserves" all distances
      from $v$.
      (This tree is called a \udefine{BFS tree}).
      \begin{myIndent} \hThreeOld
         Let $G$ be a connected graph and let $(v_1, v_2, v_3,
         \ldots, v_n)$ be any ordering of the vertices of $G$.
         \retTwo
         Pick a vertex $v=v_1$ to be the root of the BFS tree.
         \retTwo
         Now, at any stage in constructing this tree, we will have
         a vertex set $V(T) = \{v_1, v_2 \ldots, v_k\}$ (when we first
         start, $V(T)$ will only contain $v_0$. So don't worry about that).
         Now if $V(T)=V(G)$ we can stop. Otherwise though, we can say 
         that there is a smallest integer $i$ such that for $v_i \in V(T)$, 
         $\hspace{0.25em} N(v_i)\setminus V(T) \neq \emptyset$.
         Choose $v_{k+1}$ to be the smallest neighbor (by the ordering of $V(G)$) of $v_i$ 
         not in $T$ and add 
         the edge $\{v_i, v_{k+1}\}$ to $T$. Then we repeat this paragraph.
         \retTwo
         Beware the ordering we are creating in our tree will often
         be different from the order of the graph you started with.

Note that a tree is "minimally connecting" as subtracting any edge from a tree will produce a disconnected graph.
\begin{myIndent}
   We know this is the case because if we could remove an edge and still have the graph be connected, then that would imply the existence of a path between two neighboring vertices that doesn't go through their shared edge. But then, we'd be able to make a cycle subgraph by adding their shared edge to that path.

   \uuline{Theorem}: A graph is bipartite if and only if it contains no odd cycles.

   {\hThree
   \begin{myIndent}
      Proof: \\($\Longrightarrow$) First note that an odd cycle isn't bipartite. Thus, any graph containing an odd cycle is not bipartite. \retTwo

      ($\Longleftarrow$) Now supposed we are given some graph $G$ with no odd cycles. \\
      Then, assuming $G$ is connected (if $G$ isn't connected, we can break $G$ up into its component subgraphs and do this process for each component), we can construct a BFS-tree in $G$ rooted at some $v\in V(G)$. Let us name this tree $T$.
      \newpage

      Now as noted before, $T$ will have layers $L_i$ where each \\ $L_i=\{u\in V(G) \mid d_G(v, u)=i\}$. Using those layers, we can partition $T$ into two subsets $A$ and $B$ where $A$ is the union of all $L_i$ where $i$ is even and $B$ is the union of all $L_j$ where $j$ is odd. So, $T$ is clearly bipartite.
      \retTwo

      Now, let's reinsert the removed edges from $G$ back into $T$. Note that for each re-inserted edge $e$, it must be the case that either $e$ is a subset of some $L_i$ or that $e$ goes between some $L_i$ and $L_{i+1}$. Importantly, edges of the latter case do not violate our partition. So, if all the edges in $E(G) \setminus E(T)$ go between layers, then we can conclude that $G$ is definitely bipartite just like $T$.
      \retTwo

      With that, we now intend to show that an edge $G$ having an edge belonging to a single layer $L_i$ guarentees that $G$ contains an odd cycle.
      {\begin{myIndent} \hFour
         Assume the graph $G$ has an edge $\{u, w\}\subseteq L_i$ where $L_i$ is the $i$th layer of a BFS tree rooted at $v$. Then, we know that there exists a path $P_1$ contained in that BFS tree going from $v$ to $u$ and a path $P_2$ contained in that BFS tree going from $v$ to $w$. In order to draw a cycle from this information, let $x$ be the vertex of some $L_j$ such that $x\in V(P_1)$, $x\in V(P_2)$, and $j$ is as large as possible. That way, by defining the subpaths ${P_1}^\prime$ going from $x$ to $u$ and ${P_2}^\prime$ going from $x$ to $w$, we can get the following cyclic subgraph of $G$ :\[ C=(V({P_1}^\prime)\cup V({P_2}^\prime), E({P_1}^\prime)\cup E({P_2}^\prime) \cup \{u, w\})\]

         However, now note that $\lvert E({P_1}^\prime) \rvert = \lvert E({P_2}^\prime) \rvert = i-j$. Hence, \\$\lvert E(C) \rvert = 2(i-j)+1$, which in turn means that $C$ has an odd number of edges. So, we have shown that if a graph $G$ contains an edge within a single layer $L_i$, then we can give an example of an odd cycle within $G$. \retTwo
      \end{myIndent}}

      So in conclusion, if we assume $G$ has no odd cycles, then $G$ can't have any edges which are subsets of a single layer $L_i$. But that means that every edge in $G$ respects the partition we made to show that $T$ is bipartite. So, $G$ must also be bipartite with the same partition as $T$. $\blacksquare$

\markLecture{1/18/2024}

Before finding conditions for the existence of an eulerian tour of a graph, let's \\establish some terminology for digraphs so that we can study Eulerian tours in \\digraphs as well. \retTwo

Firstly, a walk, trail, and tour are defined almost identically in a digraph as in a graph. The one difference is that given some edge $(u, v)$ of a digraph, a walk, trail, and path are only allowed to traverse that edge going from $u$ to $v$. \retTwo

Given a digraph $(V, E)$, the "out" and "in" neighborhoods of a vertex $v \in V$ are:
\begin{myIndent}
   \begin{itemize}
      \item[{\color{BrickRed}out:}] $N^+(v)=\{w\in V \mid (v, w) \in E\}$
      \item[{\color{BrickRed}\phantom{o}in:}] $N^-(v)=\{w\in V \mid (w, v) \in E\}$
   \end{itemize}
\end{myIndent} \retTwo

Similarly, the out-degree and in-degree of $v \in V$ are:
\begin{myIndent}
   \begin{itemize}
      \item[{\color{BrickRed}out:}] $d^+(v)=\lvert N^+(v) \rvert$
      \item[{\color{BrickRed}\phantom{o}in:}] $d^-(v)=\lvert N^-(v) \rvert$
   \end{itemize}
\end{myIndent} \retTwo

A digraph is called \udefine{Eulerian} if for each vertex $v \hspace{0.25em}$, $d^+(v)=d^-(v)$.

   \begin{enumerate}
      \item A graph has an Eulerian tour if and only if it is connected and Eulerian.
      \item A digraph has an Eulerian tour if and only if it has a connected underlying graph and if it is Eulerian. \retTwo
   \end{enumerate}

   \hThree
   Proof of statement 1:
   \begin{myIndent}
      ($\Longrightarrow$) If $G$ has an Eulerian tour $v_0 e_0 v_1 e_1 v_2 e_2 \ldots v_k e_k v_0$, then for any $v_i$, the tour has to use an edge into $v_i$ and an edge out of $v_i$ each time it visits $v_i$. So, $d(v_i)$ is even for all $i$. \retTwo

      ($\Longleftarrow$) Now suppose $G$ is connected and all vertices have even degree. Then let $T=v_0 e_0 v_1 e_1 v_2 e_2 \ldots v_l e_l v_{l+1}$ be a longest trail in $G$. \retTwo
      
      If $v_{l+1} \neq v_0$, then we know that $v_{l+1}$ has an odd degree in $T$ as the trail goes into $v_{l+1}$ and doesn't leave. However, because we assumed that all vertices in $G$ have an even degree, we know there must be an even number of edges coming out of $v_{l+1}$. So, we can add another edge to our trail to get a longer trail. But this contradicts our assumption that $T$ is a longest trail in $G$. Hence, we conclude that $v_{l+1} = v_0$, meaning $T$ is a tour.\retTwo
      
      Now consider if $T$ is not an Eulerian tour. In that case, there is an edge of $G$ not in $T$. Additionally, because $G$ is connected, we know that that edge will have the form $e = \{v_i, w\}$. So now consider a new trail: $T^\prime$ defined as $v_i e_i v_{i+1} e_{i+1} \ldots v_0 e_0 v_1 e_1 \ldots v_i e w$. Importantly, $T^\prime$ is a longer trail than $T$. So we have a contradiction as $T$ is not a longest trail. \retTwo

      Therefore, the longest trail $T$ in $G$ must be an Eulerian tour. \retTwo

   The proof of statement 2 is nearly identical. \retTwo

   \uuline{Dirac's Theorem}: Let $n \geq 3$ and let $G$ be an $n$-vertex graph of minimum degree at least $\frac{n}{2}$. Then $G$ is hamiltonian. \retTwo

   
   {\begin{myIndent} \hThree
      Proof:\\ Suppose the theorem is false. Let $G$ be a counter-example with as many edges as possible (a maximal counter-example). Then, we know there exists an edge $\{u, v\} \notin E(G)$ as $G$ cannot equal $K_n$ since $K_n$ is hamiltonian. Furthermore, we know that $G + \{u, v\}$ is hamiltonian since $G$ was maximal. So, there is a hamiltonian cycle $C \subseteq G + \{u, v\}$ using the edge $\{u, v\}$. This in  turn means that $C - \{u, v\}$ is a hamiltonian path belonging to $G$.
      \retTwo

      Let $P=v_1e_1v_2e_2\ldots e_nv_n$ be the hamiltonian path in $G$ from $u$ to $v$ and let $N^+(w)$ denote the set of vertices immediately following a neighbor of $w$ on the path $P$. In other words: $N^+(w) = \{v_{i+1} \mid v_i \in N_G(w)\}$. \retTwo

      By the theorem's assumption about the minimum degree of the graph,\\ we know that $\left| N_G(u) \right| \geq \frac{n}{2}$. Meanwhile on the other end of $P$, since\\ $v=v_n \notin N_G(v)$, we know that every neighbor of $v$ has an element\\ following it on the path. So $\left| N^+(v) \right| \geq \frac{n}{2}$. Thus $\left| N_G(u) \right| + \left| N^+(v) \right| \geq n$.\\ But now note that $u$ does not belong to either of the above sets. So\\ $\left| N_G(u) \cup N^+(v) \right| \leq n-1$. As a consequence of this, $\left| N_G(u) \cap N^+(v) \right| > 0$.

      Let $v_i$ be a vertex belonging to $(N_G(v) \cap N^+(u))$. Then we can draw a cycle in $G$ visiting all the vertices of $G$ in the following order: \[v_1, v_2, \ldots, v_{i-1}, v_n, v_{n-1}, \ldots, v_i, v_1\]

      This contradicts our assumption that $G$ would be a counter example and thus not Hamiltonian. So, we assume no such counter example exists. \retTwo

   We can also show that Dirac's Theorem gives the best possible minimum degree for a graph to be guarenteably Hamiltonian. Consider a graph $G$ containing two copies of $K_m$ sharing exactly one vertex. In that case, $n = \left| V(G) \right| = 2m - 1$ and\\ $\delta(G) = m-1 = \frac{n-1}{2}$. However, this graph does not have a spanning subcycle as any spanning cycle would have to cross that shared vertex twice. \retTwo

Let $P$ be a longest path in $G$ going from a vertex $u$ to a vertex $v$. Additionally, for any $w \in V(P)$, let $w^+$ be the vertex following $w$ as one travels from $u$ to $v$ along $P$. Importantly, since $P$ is a longest path, we know that $(N_G(u) \cup N_G(v)) \subseteq V(P)$. Furthermore, for each $w \in N_G(v)$, we can define $Q = P - \{w, w^+\} + \{v, w\}$ where $Q$ is a longest path of $G$ going from $u$ to $w^+$ instead of $u$ to $v$. We call $Q$ a \udefine{rotation} of $P$ at $v$.

      Proof:\\ Let $P$ be a longest path ending at a vertex $v$. Also, let $S$ be the set of end \\vertices of all possible longest paths that could be obtained through any \\number of rotations starting with $P$. Finally, let $S^+$ and $S^-$ denoted the \\vertices of $P$ immediately after and immediately before vertices in $S$ \\respectively. \retTwo

      Obviously, $\lvert S^+ \rvert \leq \lvert S \rvert$ and $\lvert S^- \rvert \leq \lvert S \rvert$ as all vertices except the first and last vertex of $P$ have exactly one vertex before and after them in $P$. Also note that $N(S) \subseteq S^+ \cup S^-$. This is because if there did exist $w \in N(S)$ such that $w \notin S^+ \cup S^-$, then we would know that no rotation of $P$ made it so that $w$ was not proceeded by $w^-$ and followed by $w^+$. So, doing a rotation with the vertex $w$, we would show that either $w^+$ or $w^-$ belonged to $S$, thus reaching a contradiction. 
      \newpage

      Overall, this means that $\lvert N(S) \rvert \leq \lvert S^+ \cup S^- \rvert \leq \lvert S^+ \rvert + \lvert S^- \rvert \leq 2 \lvert S \rvert$.\\ However, note that by the theorem's assumption about $G$, we know that $\left|S\right| \geq t$ because otherwise we'd have that $ 2\left| S \right| < \left|N(S)\right|$. So, let $T$ be a subset of $S$ such that $\left| T \right| = t$. Then, because $T$ and $N(T)$ are disjoint\\ subsets of $(S \cup N(S))$ which itself is a subset of $V(P)$, we know that\\ $\left| V(P) \right| \geq \left| T \right| + \left| N(T) \right|$. And since $\left| N(T) \right| > 2\left| T \right| = 2t$ by the theorem's assumption about $G$, we thus can say that $\left| V(P) \right| > 3t$. $\blacksquare$ \retTwo

   \uuline{Theorem}: If for every set $S$ of vertices in a graph $G$, we have that\\ $\left| N(S) \right| \geq \min{\{2\left|S\right| + 1, \hspace{0.25em} \left|V(G) \setminus S \right|\}}$, then $G$ has a hamiltonian path. \retTwo

   {\begin{myIndent} \hThree
      Proof:\\ Once again let us define $P$ as a longest path of $G$, as well as $S$ as the set of end vertices of all possible rotations of $P$. Then by the same reasoning as before, we know that $\left| N(S) \right| \leq 2 \left| S \right|$. Therefore, since $\left| N(S) \right|$ isn't greater than or equal to $2 \left| S \right| + 1$, we know by the assumption of the theorem that $N(S)$ is greater than or equal to $\left|V(G) \setminus S \right|$. \retTwo

      Now $S \cup (V(G) \setminus S) = V(G)$ and $(S \cup N(S)) \subseteq V(P)$. Additionally, $S$ and $(V(G) \setminus S)$ are disjoint to each other, as is $S$ and $N(S)$. Thus, we can say that \[
         \left| V(G) \right| = \left| S \right| + \left| (V(G) \setminus S) \right| \geq \left| S \right| + \left| N(S) \right| \leq \left| V(P) \right| \]

A graph is \udefine{uniquely Hamiltonian} if it has exactly one Hamiltonian cycle. \retTwo

{\begin{myIndent} \hTwo
   \uuline{Theorem}: If all vertices in a graph $G$ have odd degree, then every edge is in an even number of hamiltonian cycles.
   
   {\begin{myTindent}\begin{myIndent} \teachComment
      In other words such a graph is not uniquely Hamiltonian. \retTwo

   {\begin{myIndent} \hThree
      Proof: \\
      If the graph $G$ in the theorem has no hamiltonian cycles, then we're done. Every edge is in $0$ hamiltonian cycles. \retTwo

      Now pick an edge and suppose that there is a Hamiltonian cycle $C$ containing it. We'll call that edge $\{u, v\}$ and let $w$ be the vertex coming before $u$ on $C$. \retTwo
      
      Then, let us define a new graph $H$ whose vertices are Hamiltonian paths in $G$ which start with the edge $\{u, v\}$. For example, $(C - \{u, w\}) \in V(H)$. Additionally, let $\{P, Q\}$ be an edge of $H$ if $P$ and $Q$ are rotations of each other. \retTwo

      If $P \in V(H)$ is a hamiltonian path in $G$ ending in a vertex $x \in V(G)$, then: \[d_H(P) = \left\{\begin{matrix}
         d_G(x) - 1 & & x \notin N_G(u) \\
         d_G(x) - 2 & & x \in N_G(u)
      \end{matrix}\right.\]
      {\begin{myIndent} \hFour
         Essentially, for every edge connecting to $x$ except for the one already used by $P$, there is a rotation of $P$. We can then say that that rotation is a vertex of $H$ if it includes the edge $\{u, v\}$ (In other words, a rotation including the edge $\{u, x\}$ would not be included in $H$).
      \end{myIndent}}

      \retTwo
      If $x$ is adjacent to $u$, then $P + \{\{u, x\}\}$ is a hamiltonian cycle containing $\{u, v\}$. \retTwo

      Now here is the clever part: since $d_G(x)$ is assumed to be odd for all \\$v \in V(G)$, we have that $d_H(P)$ is even if $x$ is not adjacent to $u$ and odd if $x$ is adjacent to $u$. But now note that every graph has an even number of vertices of odd degree because of the handshaking lemma. So, there must be an even number of paths including the edge $\{u, v\}$ and ending in a vertex $x$ such that $x$ is adjacent to $u$. Or in other words, $G$ has an even number of hamiltonian cyles containing the edge $\{u, v\}$. $\blacksquare$

   {\begin{myIndent} \hThree
      Proof:\\
      ($\Longrightarrow$) If $G$ has a matching $M$ containing $A$, then for any $X \subseteq A$, we trivially have that $\left| N_G(X)\right| \geq \left| N_m(X) \right| = \left| X \right|$. \retTwo
      ($\Longleftarrow$) To prove the other way, we proceed by induction on $A$ while assuming Hall's condition is true. \retTwo

      Base case: assume that $\left| A \right| = 1$. In that case, because Hall's condition is assumed to be true, we know that $\left| N_G(A) \right| \geq \left| A \right| = 1$. Thus, for some $a \in A$ and $b \in B$, we know there exists an edge $\{a, b\} \in E(G)$. The matching of just that edge saturates $A$.

      \newpage

      Induction step:  Assume that Hall's theorem works if $1 \leq \left| A \right| < n$. Then assume that $\left| A \right| = n$. Since we are assuming Hall's condition to be true, we know that for all proper subsets $X \subset A$, either $\lvert N_G(X) \rvert > \lvert X \rvert$ or\\ $\lvert N_G(X) \rvert = \lvert X \rvert$ is true. \retTwo

      \begin{itemize}
         \item Case 1: For all proper subsets $X$ of $A, \hspace{0.5em}\lvert N_G(X) \rvert > \lvert X \rvert$\dots\\ {\hFour
            Pick an edge $\{a, b\} \in E(G)$ and consider $H = G - \{a\} - \{b\}$. We know that $H$ will be a bipartite graph with two sets of vertices: $A^\prime = A \setminus \{a\}$,\\ and $B^\prime = B \setminus \{b\}$. Additionally, given any $X \subseteq A^\prime$, we know that\\ $\lvert N_H(X) \rvert \geq \lvert N_G(X) \rvert - 1 \geq \lvert X \rvert$. So, by our inductive hypothesis, $H$ has a matching covering $A^\prime$. Now add the edge $\{a, b\}$ to this matching to get a matching in $G$ covering $A$.
         } 
         \retTwo

         \item Case 2: There exists a proper subset $X$ of $A$ such that $\left|N_G(X)\right| = \left| X \right|$\dots\\ {\hFour
            In this second case our reasoning for case 1 breaks down because given $X \subseteq A^\prime$, we can no longer guarentee that $\lvert N_G(X) \rvert - 1 \geq \lvert X \rvert$. So, using that same set $X$,  consider $G_1$ the induced graph of $N_G(X) \cup X$ and $G_2$ equal to $G - V(G_1)$. \retTwo

            For any $Y \subseteq X$, we have that $\left| N_{G_1}(Y) \right| = \left| N_G(Y) \right| \geq \left| Y \right|$ due to Hall's\\ condition. Thus, by our inductive hypothesis there exists a matching $M_1$ saturating $X$ in $G_1$. \retTwo

            Additionally, for any $Y \subseteq A \setminus X$, consider $N_G(Y \cup X)$. By assuming Hall's condition, we know that $\lvert N_G(Y \cup X) \rvert \geq \left| Y \cup X \right|$. And, because $X$ and $Y$ are disjoint, $\left| Y \cup X \right| = \left| Y \right| + \left| X \right|$. On the other hand, we also know that $N_G(Y \cup X) = N_{G_2}(Y) + N_G(X)$. So, $\left|N_{G_2}(Y)\right| + \left| N_G(X) \right| \geq \left| Y \right| + \left| X \right|$. Finally, because $\left|N_G(X)\right| = \left| X \right|$, we can cancel terms to get that:\\ $\left| N_{G_2}(Y) \right| \geq \left| Y \right|$. Hence by our inductive hypothesis, we know there exists a matching $M_2$ saturating $A \setminus X$ in $G_2$. \retTwo

            We now can combine $M_1$ and $M_2$ in order to get a matching in $G$ covering $A$.

      Side proposition: if in additional to Hall's condition holding, $\lvert A \rvert = \lvert B \rvert$, then the matching for $G$ generated by the above proof is perfect. Meanwhile, if $\lvert A \rvert \neq \lvert B \rvert$, then it is impossible to make a perfect matching. To prove this, assume without loss of generality that $\lvert A \rvert < \lvert B \rvert$. Then, because $\left| N_G(B) \right|$ is a most $\left| A \right|$, we know that $\left| N_G(B) \right| < \left| B \right|$. So no matching can exist covering $B$.

      Let $X \subseteq A$. Then the number of edges going out from $X$ to $B$, written as $e(X, B)$, is equal to $r\left|X\right|$. Meanwhile, the number of edges going from $N(X)$ back to $A$ is equal to $e(N(X), A) = r\left|N(X)\right|$. \retTwo

      Now note that every edge counted in $e(X, B)$ is also counted in $e(N(X), A)$. Therefore, $r\left|X\right| = e(X, B) \leq e(N(X), A) = r\left|N(X)\right|$. And finally as $r>0$, we have that $\left| X \right| \leq \left| N(X) \right|$. Thus Hall's condition is satisfied. \retTwo

      Because Hall's condition is satisfied, we know by Hall's theorem that there is a matching $M_1$ saturating $A$. Additionally, because the total number of edges in the graph is equal to $e(A, B) = r\left|A\right| = r\left|B\right|$, we know that $\left|A\right| = \left|B\right|$. So the matching we found that saturates $A$ also saturates $B$. \retTwo
   
      Now, that we've a found a $1$-factor $M_1$, let's now subtract $M_1$ from our\\ bipartite graph. Then, the resulting subgraph is $(r-1)$ regular. So, we can apply the above reasoning again and again to get more $1$-factors. And\\ importantly, all of these $1$-factors must be disjoint.
      \retTwo After $r$ iterations, our bipartite graph will have no edges left and we will have created a collection of $r$ many $1$-factors whose union is the original edge\\ set. $\blacksquare$ \retTwo

         \item Meanwhile, because no odd component of $G - S$ can have a perfect matching, we know that each odd component of $G - S$ must contribute at least one exposed vertex to an optimal matching of $G - S$. So\\ $\oddComp{G - S} \leq \epsilon$.

\retTwo

This condition is called \udefine{Tutte's condition}. As shown above, it is a necessary condition for a graph to have a perfect matching. However, it happens to also be a sufficient condition.

{\begin{myIndent} \hTwo
   \uuline{Theorem}: A graph $G$ has a perfect matching if and only if $\oddComp{G - S} \leq S$ for every set $S \subseteq V(G)$.

   \begin{myIndent} \hThree
      Proof: \\
      We already showed that Tutte's condition was necessary for a graph to have a perfect matching. So, what we need to show now is that assuming Tutte's condition holds, you can construct a perfect matching. \retTwo

      We shall proceed by induction. Firstly note that if $S = \emptyset$, then there must be zero odd components. Therefore, Tutte's condition already limits us to focuing on graphs with an even total number of vertices. So, let our base case be when $|V(G)| = 2$. In that case   $G = K_2$ and so $G$ has a perfect matching.

      \newpage
      Now suppose $V(G) > 2$ and that our theorem holds for any graph with less than $V(G)$ vertices.\retTwo Let $S$ be the largest subset of $V(G)$ such that $|S| = \oddComp{G - S}$. We know that $S$ is nonempty because if $|S|$ equals $1$, the equality must hold.
      {\begin{myIndent} \hFour
         $|V(G)|$ having to be even implies that $|V(G)| - 1$ is odd. So $G - S$ must have an odd number of odd component. But by Tutte's condition, we know the number of odd components is at most $1$. Hence, equality must hold when $|S| = 1$.
      \end{myIndent}}
      This guarentees that $V(G - S) \leq V(G)$. \retTwo

      Let's now consider any even component of $G - S$ which we shall denote $H$. We claim that $H$ has a perfect matching.
      {\begin{myIndent} \hFour
         Consider any $R \subseteq V(H)$. Because $R$ only contains vertices from an even component of $G - S$, we have that every odd component in $G - S$ is also in $G - (R \cup S)$. This combined with Tutte's condition tells us that:
         
         {\centering $\oddComp{H - R} + \oddComp{G - S} = \oddComp{G - (R \cup S)} \leq |S| + |R|$ \retTwo \par}

         However, since we specified that $|S| = \oddComp{G - S}$, we can cancel out terms to get that $\oddComp{H - R} \leq |R|$. So Tutte's condition holds for $H$. And since $V(H) < V(G)$, we can thus conclude by our inductive hypothesis that $H$ has a perfect matching. \retTwo
      \end{myIndent}}
      
      Meanwhile, consider any odd component of $G - S$ which we shall denote $F$. We claim that for any $v \in V(F)$, we know that $F^\prime = F - \{v\}$ has a perfect matching.
      {\begin{myIndent} \hFour
         Because $V(F^\prime) < V(G)$, we know by our inductive hypothesis that if $F^\prime$ does not have a perfect matching, then Tutte's condition must not hold. Or in other words, there exists $Q \subseteq V(F^\prime)$ such that $\oddComp{F^\prime - Q} > |Q|$. \retTwo

         Now note that for any $R \subseteq V(F)$, because $|V(F)|$ is odd ($\equiv 1 \mod{2}$):
         \begin{itemize}
            \item $|R| \myequiv{2} 0 \Longrightarrow |V(F - R)| \myequiv{2} 1 \Longrightarrow \oddComp{F - R} \myequiv{2} 1$
            \item  $|R| \myequiv{2} 1 \Longrightarrow |V(F - R)| \myequiv{2} 0 \Longrightarrow \oddComp{F - R} \myequiv{2} 0$
         \end{itemize}
         So $\oddComp{F - R} + |R| \myequiv{2} |V(F)| \myequiv{2} 1$. \retTwo

         This means that $\oddComp{F - (Q \cup \{v\})} + |Q| + 1 \myequiv{2} 1$, which in turn says that $\oddComp{F^\prime - Q} + |Q| \myequiv{2} 0$. So both $\oddComp{F^\prime - Q}$ and $|Q|$ must have the same parity, meaning that  $\oddComp{F^\prime - Q} > |Q| \Rightarrow \oddComp{F^\prime - Q} \geq |Q| + 2$. \retTwo

         Also observe that $\oddComp{G - S \cup \{v\} \cup Q} = \oddComp{G - S} - 1 + \oddComp{F^\prime - Q}$. This is because every odd component of $G - S$ except for $F$ is also an odd component of $G - S \cup \{v\} \cup Q$. \retTwo

         Therefore we can say by Tutte's condition that:

         {\center$ |S| + |Q| + 1 \geq  \oddComp{G - S} - 1 + \oddComp{F^\prime - Q} \geq \oddComp{G - S} + |Q| + 1$.\par}

         \newpage

         Therefore we've shown that $\oddComp{G - S \cup \{v\} \cup Q} = |S \cup \{v\} \cup Q|$.\\ However, this contradicts our previous assertion that $S$ is the largest subset of $V(G)$ such that $\oddComp{G - S} = |S|$. So we have shown that $Q$ cannot exist, meaning that $F^\prime$ has a perfect matching. \retTwo
      \end{myIndent}}

      Finally, let $C$ be the set of vertices consisting of one vertex from each odd component of $G - S$ such that each vertex in $C$ has an edge connecting to $S$. Then consider the bipartite graph $G(S, C)$ consisting of every edge in $G$ going between $C$ and $S$. We claim that this bipartite graph has a perfect matching.
      {\begin{myIndent} \hFour
         For every $X \subseteq C$, we know that removing $N(X)$ will make the components which each $x \in X = C$ belong to odd. So $|X| = \oddComp{G - N(X)}$. And by Tutte's condition: $\oddComp{G - N(X)} \leq N(X)$. So $|X| \leq |N(X)|$, meaning that by Hall's theorem, $G(S, C)$ has a perfect matching. \retTwo
      \end{myIndent}}

      Combining all the perfect matchings we made for $G(S, C)$ and each $H$ and $F^\prime$, we get a perfect matching for all $G$. $\blacksquare$

\end{myIndent}}

\mySepTwo

A \udefine{bridge} is an edge which when removed increases the number of components of a graph. Meanwhile, a \udefine{cubic} graph is a graph that is 3-regular. \retTwo

{\begin{myIndent} \hTwo
   \uuline{Petersen's Theorem}: Every bridgless cubic graph $G$ has a perfect matching.

   {\begin{myIndent}\hThree
      We check that for all $S \subseteq V(G)$, we have that $\oddComp{G - S} \leq |S|$. \retTwo

      By handshaking lemma, each component of $G$ must have an even number of vertices. Thus, if $S = \emptyset$, then $\oddComp{G - S} = \oddComp{G} = 0$. \retTwo

      Now suppose if $S \neq \emptyset$. Then each component of $G - S$ sends at least two edges to $S$ since $G$ is bridgeless. However, consider a hypothetical odd\\ component $H$ of $G - S$. Because the sum of degrees of $H$ must be even, we know that $H$ must send an odd number of edges to $S$. Therefore if every component of $G - S$ was odd, then the number of edges coming into $S$ must be at least $3(\oddComp{G - S})$. But, because $G$ is $3$-regular, the max number of edges that $S$ could possibly accept is $3|S|$. So, $\oddComp{G - S} \leq |S|$. \retTwo

\begin{myIndent}
   \uuline{König-Ore Theorem}: Let $G$ be a bipartite graph with parts $A$ and $B$. Additionally, define $\exposed{G, A} = |A| - \mu(G)$. In other words, this is the number of vertices in $A$ exposed by a maximum matching. Then:

   {\centering $\exposed{G, A} = \max\limits_{S\subseteq A}{\{|S| - |N(S)|\}}$ \par}


   \begin{myIndent} \hThree
      Proof:\\
      Denote the right hand side of the above equation by $d$. Then consider adding $d$ vertices to $B$ which are all adjacent to all vertices of $A$. Hall's condition is trivially true in this new graph, meaning that this new graph has a matching covering all vertices of $A$. Therefore, when we remove those added vertices and edges from our matching over $A$, we will still have a matching covering at least $|A|-d$ vertices in $A$. So, $\exposed{G, A} \leq d$.\retTwo
      
      On the other hand, if $M$ is a matching of size: $|A| - \exposed{G, A}$, meaning that $M$ is a maximum matching, then each $S \subseteq A$ has at least $|S| - \exposed{G, A}$ neighbors in $B$. Or in other words, $|N(S)| \geq |S| - \exposed{G, A}$ We know this because Hall's condition applise to $A$ if we remove the exposed vertices in $A$. Then, by subtracting $\exposed{G, A}$ from $|S|$, we are effectively canceling the influence of those exposed points which cause Hall's Theorem to fail. We can rewrite the above formula as $\exposed{G, A} \geq |S| - |N(S)|$. And since this is true for all $S$, we thus know that $d = \max\limits_{S\subseteq A}{\{|S| - |N(S)|\}} \leq \exposed{G, A}$

      So in conlusion: $d \leq \exposed{G, A} \leq d \Longrightarrow d = \exposed{G, A}$.

      If $|E(G)| = |V(G)| - 1$, then $G$ is a tree and $|F(G)|=1$. So equality holds. \retTwo
      
      Now assume that the formula holds if $|E(G)| = |V(G)| + n - 1$ for some integer $n \geq 0$. Then consider a graph $G$ such that $|E(G)| = |V(G)| + n$.\\ We know that $G$ cannot be tree and so $G$ must contain a cycle $C$. If $e \in E(C)$,\\ then $G - \{e\}$ is still connected.

      Note that $F(G - \{e\}) = F(G) - 1$ because by removing $e$, we removed the boundary seperating two different faces, thus merging them. Additionally, $V(G) = V(G - \{e\})$ and $E(G) = E(G - \{e\}) - 1$. So we can thus conclude that: $|V(G)| - (|E(G)| - 1) + (|F(G) - 1) = 2$. Or in other words:

   {\begin{myIndent} \hThree
      Proof:\\
      Firstly, observe that if a graph $G$ is $d$-degenerate, then any subgraph resulting by removing vertices from $G$ will also be $d$-degenerate. \retTwo
      Also, observe that for any induced subgraph $H$ of $G$, we clearly have that $\delta(H) \leq d$. Therefore, assuming $H$ is nonempty, we know there exists a vertex $v \in V(H)$ such that $d(v) \leq d$. \retTwo
      Using the above two observation, we can do induction over a $d$-degenerate graph as follows:

         For each integer $i \in \{1,\ldots,|V(G)|\}$, remove a vertex $v_i$ from\\ $H_i = G - \{v_1, \ldots, v_{i-1}\}$ satisfying the property that $d_{H_i}(v_i) \leq d$. \retTwo

         Doing this, we will eventually be left with an empty graph. This graph\\ obviously has a proper coloring using at most $d + 1$ colors.\retTwo Next, consider adding vertices back in. For any $i \in \{1,\ldots,|V(G)|\}$, we shall inductively assume that $G - \{v_1, \ldots, v_{i-1}, v_i\}$ has a proper coloring using less than $d + 1$ colors. Then, because we specified that $v_i$ has at most a degree of $d$ in $G - \{v_1, \ldots, v_{i-1}\}$, we know there is at least one available color to assign $v_i$. So $G - \{v_1, \ldots, v_{i-1}\}$ has a proper coloring using at most $d + 1$ colors. $\blacksquare$

   \uuline{Brook's Theorem}: If $G$ is a connected graph, then $\chi(G) \leq \Delta G$ unless $G$ is an odd cycle or a complete graph.

   {\begin{myIndent} \hThree
      Proof: (we shall proceed by induction on the number of vertices in $G$)\retTwo

      To start, consider that $\chi(K_n) = \Delta(K_n) + 1$. Similarly for an odd cycle $C$, we have that $\chi(C) = \Delta(C) + 1$. Hence, this is why Brook's theorem specifies that $G$ is not one of the above graphs. Additionally, note that if $\Delta G < 3$, then the theorem is obviously true. So, we only need to focus on when $\Delta G \geq 3$. \retTwo

      Now, note that we may assume for all $v \in V(G)$ that $G - \{v\}$ is connected. 
      {\begin{myIndent} \hFour
         After all, if $G - \{v\}$ was not connected, then we could write $G$ as the\\ union of two smaller connected graphs: $G_1$ and $G_2$ such that\\ $V(G_1) \cap V(G_2) = \{v\}$. Now if $G_i$ is an odd cycle or a complete graph,\\ then we know $\chi(G_i) = \Delta(G_i) + 1$. However, then $\Delta(G_i) \leq \Delta(G) - 1$ because the degree of the vertex connecting $G_i$ to the rest of $G$ is equal to $\Delta(G_i)$. Meanwhile if $G_i$ is not an odd cycle or complete graph,\\ then we can inductively prove Brook's Theorem for $G_i$ to get that\\ $\chi(G_i) \leq \Delta(G_i) \leq \Delta(G)$. In either case, we will get a coloring over $G_i$ using at most $\Delta G$ colors. \retTwo

         So $G_1$ and $G_2$ both have colorings with at most $\Delta(G)$ colors. By setting $v$ in both graphs to have the same color, we  can then merge the colorings of $G_1$ and $G_2$ to get a suitable coloring of $G$.
         \retTwo
      \end{myIndent}}

      Thus, assume that $G - \{v\}$ is connected for all $v \in V(G)$. Then, if\\ $G \neq K_{\Delta(G) + 1}$, we can pick vertices $v_1$, $v_{n-1}$ and $v_{n}$ such that\\ $\{v_1, v_{n-1}\} \in E(G)$, $\{v_1, v_{n}\} \in E(G)$, and $\{v_{n-1}, v_{n}\} \notin E(G)$. \retTwo

      \uuline{Case 1}: Suppose $H = G - \{v_n\} - \{v_{n-1}\}$ is connected. Then, we can order the vertices of $H$: $v_1, v_2, \ldots, v_{n-2}$ so that for $i \geq 2$, $v_i$ always has at least one neighbor $v_j$ where $j < i$.
      {\begin{myTindent}\begin{myTindent} \teachComment
         This was proven in a homework exercise\dots\retTwo
      \end{myTindent}\end{myTindent}}

      Assign $v_n$ and $v_{n-1}$ the color $1$. Then, considering our graph $G$, since $v_i$ has at most $\Delta(G) - 1$ neighbors $v_j$ where $i < j$, we can iterate from $v_{n-2}$ to $v_2$, assigning whatever color is available to each vertex. After all, it is guarenteed that we will not have assigned all $\Delta(G)$ colors to the neighborhood of $v_i$ yet since we could have only assigned $\Delta(G) - 1$ colors at most.
      {\begin{myTindent} \hFour
         If $v_i$ is neighbors with $v_n$ or $v_{n+1}$ then that just means it isn't neighbors with one or two more $v_j$ in our ordering. So, this doesn't affect our conclusion. \retTwo
      \end{myTindent}}

      Also, the number of colors assigned in $N(v_1)$ is at most $\Delta(G) - 1$ since two of $v_1$'s neighbors are assigned the same color. So we can assign it a remaining color afterwards. Hence $G$ has a proper coloring. \retTwo

      \newpage

      \uuline{Case 2}: Now suppose $H = G - \{v_n\} - \{v_{n+1}\}$ is disconnected. Then we may view $G$ as the union of two smaller connected graphs $G_1$ and $G_2$ such that $V(G_1) \cap V(G_2) = \{v_n, v_{n+1}\}$. By the same type of induction that we did earlier, we can prove that $G_1$ and $G_2$ can be covered by at most $\Delta(G)$ colors. So, choose a coloring such that $v_n$ and $v_{n+1}$ are assigned the same colors in both $G_1$ and $G_2$. Then, we can merge the two colorings to get a proper coloring of $G$. $\blacksquare$
   \end{myIndent}}

   Note that $\Delta(G)$ can differ greatly from $\chi(G)$. For instance, bipartite graphs are always $2$-colorable no matter how many edges they have.

   \uuline{The $5$-color Theorem}:  If $G$ is a planar graph, then $\chi(G) \leq 5$.
   {\hThree 
   \begin{myIndent}
      Proof:\\
      If $|V(G)| \leq 5$, then we may simply assign all vertices different colors to show that $\chi(G) \leq 5$. So, consider when $|V(G)| \geq 6$.\retTwo

      Then if $\delta(G) \leq 4$, we know there exists $v \in V(G)$ such that $d_G(v) \leq 4$. So, by induction we can find a proper $5$-coloring of $G - \{v\}$. And because $v$ has at most $4$ neighbors, there is at least one color left over to assign $v$ afterwards.\\ Meanwhile, because of the previous theorem, we know that any induced\\ subgraph of $G$ will have a minimum degree of at most $5$. So, the only \\non-trivial case we need to prove is when $\delta(G) = 5$. \retTwo

      Thus, assume there exists a vertex $v \in V(G)$ such that $d(v) = 5$. Since $K_5$ is not planar, there exists some pair of vertices: $a, b \in N_G(v)$ which are not\\ adjacent. Define $H = G \slash \{a, b\}$ with a new vertex $w$ adjacent to\\ $N_G(v) \cup N_g(a)$. \retTwo

      Next contract $H$ again, defining $I = H \slash \{b, w\}$ with a new vertex $x$ adjacent to $N_H(w) \cup N_H(b)$. Note that $I$ and $H$ are planar. Thus, since $I$ is a planar graph with less vertices than $G$, we can do induction to find a proper $5$-coloring of $I$. We'll call this coloring $c$. \retTwo

      For each $y \in V(I) \cap V(G)$, define $c^\prime(y) = c(y)$. This effectively gives a proper coloring of $G - {a} - {b} - {v}$. Then assign $c^\prime(a) = c^\prime(b) = c(x)$. We can do this because we chose $a$ and $b$ to not be adjacent and because none of $a$ and $b$'s neighbors could have been assigned $c(x)$. And finally, because $a$ and $b$ in $N(v)$ have been assigned same color, there is at least one color which we can assign to $v$. $\blacksquare$ \retTwo

      Proof:\\
      Consider triangulating $R$. In other words, add straight edges between vertices of $R$ in order to partition $R$ into a bunch of triangular regions. \retTwo
      Having done that, now consider the graph $G$ whose vertices are the vertices of $R$ and whose edges are the boundaries of the triangles of our triangulation of $R$. We can prove that $\chi(G) = 3$. \retTwo

      {\hFour
      \begin{myIndent}
         When $n = 3$, we have that $G$ consists of a single triangle. So $\chi(G) = 3$. \retTwo
         Now we proceed by induction. Assume that for $n > 3$, we know that \\$\chi(G) = 3$ if $R$ has less than $n$ sides. Therefore, we now consider a graph $G$ made from an $n$-sided polygon. Let $\{u, v\}$ be any edge of $G$ not on the boundary of the infinite face. Importantly, we know such a side will exist\\ because $n > 3$. Then, we can partition $G$ into two subgraphs $G_1$ and $G_2$ such that $V(G_1) \cap V(G_2) = \{u, v\}$ and $E(G_1) \cup E(G_2) = E(G)$. \retTwo

         $G_1$ and $G_2$ are the triangulations of some polygon with less than $n$ sides.\\ Therefore by strong induction, there exists the proper vertex $3$-colorings:\\ $c_1: V(G_1) \rightarrow \{1, 2, 3\}$, and $c_2: V(G_2) \rightarrow \{1, 2, 3\}$. Shifting around the colors so that $c_1(u) = c_2(u)$ and $c_1(v) = c_2(v)$, we can then define a proper $3$-coloring of all $G$. So $\chi(G) \leq 3$. \retTwo

         Since $G$ obviously can't be colored by 2 or less colors since the triangles in $G$ need three colors, we thus conclude that $\chi(G) = 3$. \retTwo

      Having shown that $G$ has a $3$-coloring, now note that in that $3$-coloring, the three vertices enclosing any triangular face of $G$ must all have a different color assigned to them. Additionally, every point in a triangle is mutually visible to another point in that triangle.

      Letting the least assigned color be called $i$, make $S$ the set of locations of vertices which were assigned the color $i$.

      Now if $n = k$, then $|E(G)| > (k-1)k - \binom{k}{2} = \binom{k}{2}$. But that would mean that $G$ has more edges than $K_n$, which is impossible. So, we know that $n > k$. Therefore, it makes sense to consider repeating the above step $n - k$ times. Having done that, we will get that there are more than $(k - 1)(k) - \binom{k}{2}$ edges remaining. However, that is impossible as $k$ vertex graph can't have more than $\binom{k}{2}$ edges. Hence, we conclude that the algorithm must have terminated before all $n - k$ steps could be done. \retTwo

   \uuline{Corollary}: If $G$ is a graph with $n$ vertices and more than $(k - 1)n - \binom{k}{2}$ edges, then $G$ contains a cycle of length at least $k + 1$ unless $G = K_k$.

   {\begin{myIndent} \hThree
      Proof:\\
      Let $H \subseteq G$ be a non-empty $k$-core in $G$. Since $\delta(H) \geq k$, $H$ contains a cycle of length at least $k + 1$. Thus so does $G$. $\blacksquare$

A \udefine{cut}: $(A, B)$, of a graph $G$ is a spanning subgraph of $G$ such that such that $V(G)$ is partitioned into two sets $A$ and $B$ and an edge $\{a, b\} \in E(G)$ is only included in the cut if $a \in A$ and $b \in B$. \retTwo

A \udefine{max cut} is a cut with as many edges as possible.

   \uuline{Theorem}: Every graph with $m$ edges has a cut with at least $\sfrac{m}{2}$ edges.

   {\begin{myIndent} \hThree
      Proof:\\
      Let $G$ have $m$ edges. On each vertex of $G$, flip a fair coin. 
      Then, let $A$ be the set of vertices which have heads and let $B$ be the set of vertices which have tails. That way, $(A, B)$ is a cut.
      \retTwo

      Since the assignment of each vertex is independent from the assignment of any other vertex, we have that there is a $\frac{1}{2}$ probability of any edge being included in the cut. Thus, the mean number of edges between $A$ and $B$ is: 
      \[\sum\limits_{e \in E(G)}{\mathbb{P}(e\text{ is in the cut})} = \sum\limits_{i=1}^m\frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{2}m\]

      This implies that some cut $(A, B)$ of $G$ must have at least $\sfrac{m}{2}$ edges. (It also implies some cut has at most $\sfrac{m}{2}$ edges.) \retTwo

\newpage Suppose $G_0$ is a $3$-connected cubic plane graph. Then consider the\\ maximal plane graph $G_1$ with all the vertices and edges of $G_0$. \retTwo
      
$G_0$ and thus $G_1$ must have at least $4$ vertices. An easy way to know this is that since the minimum degree of $G_0$ is $3$, we therefore know that $G_0$ has a cycle of length $4$ due to one of the first theorems covered in this class. This means that $G_1^*$ is a planar simple graph. So by assumption, $\chi(G_1^*) \leq 4$.

Let $c: V(G_1^*) \longrightarrow \{1, 2, 3, 4\}$ be a proper vertex coloring of $G_1^*$. This is equivalent to assigning a color to the faces of $G_1$ so that two faces

Let $c: V(G_1^*) \longrightarrow \{1, 2, 3, 4\}$ be a proper vertex coloring of $G_1^*$. Because $G_1^*$ is a simple graph, we have that every edge of $G_1^*$ is going between two different vertices of different colors. So, we define an edge coloring as follows:
\[c^\prime(\{u, v\}) = \left\{
\begin{matrix}
   1 & \text{ if } (c(u) = 1 \text{ and } c(v) = 2) \text{ or } (c(u) = 3 \text{ and } c(v) = 4) \\
