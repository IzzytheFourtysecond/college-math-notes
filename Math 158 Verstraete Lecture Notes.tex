   A \udefine{graph} is a pair $(V, E)$ where $V$ is a set of vertices
   and $E$ is a set of unordered pairs of elements of $V$ called edges.
   For $u, v \in V$, we say $u$ and $v$ are \udefine{adjacent} if 
   $\{u, v\} \in E$.

If $G = (V, E)$ and $v \in V$, the \udefine{neighborhood} of $v$ is
$N_{G}(v)=\{w \in V \mid \{v, w\} \in E\}$. \bigbreak

The \udefine{degree} of $v$ is $d_{G}(v) = \lvert N_{G}(v) \rvert$.
Or in other words, $v$'s degree is equal to the number of edges 
connecting to $v$.

   The \udefine{Handshaking lemma} states that for any graph $(V, E)$:
      {\fontsize{16}{15}\selectfont
      \[ \sum_{v \in V} d_{G}(v) = 2 \lvert E \rvert \]}
   
   \hThreeOld
   \begin{myIndent}
      The reason for this is that each edge increments the degrees of
      exactly two vertices. So the above sum counts every edge twice.

   \uuline{Lemma}: Every graph has an even number of vertices with odd
   degrees.

   \hThreeOld
   \begin{myIndent}
      Proof: We can split the vertices of any graph into two categories:
      those with odd degrees, and those with even degrees.
      \hfill \bigbreak
      Now recall that an even number plus an even number always equals
      an even number, as does an odd number plus an odd number. However,
      an odd\\ number plus an even numbers equals an odd number. Based on
      this fact, we can guarentee that the sum of even degrees in any
      graph is even. And since the sum of even degrees plus the sum of 
      odd degrees must be even as it equals $2 \lvert E \rvert$ by
      the Handshaking lemma, we thus know that the sum of odd degrees 
      must be even. Hence, it must be the case that there are an even 
      number of vertices with odd degree because otherwise the sum of 
      their degrees won't be even.

   A graph is called \udefine{$r$-regular} if all of its vertices have
   degree $r$.

   An $r$-dimensional \udefine{cube graph}, denoted as $\mathrm{Q}_{r}$,
   is a graph such that $V(\mathrm{Q}_{r})$, the set of vertices in 
   $\mathrm{Q}_{r}$, is equal to the set of binary strings of 
   length $r$; and $E(\mathrm{Q}_{r})$, the set of edges in 
   $\mathrm{Q}_{r}$, is equal to the set of pairs of binary strings
   which differ in only one position.

An \udefine{induced subgraph} of $G = (V, E)$ is a subgraph 
$G\left[ X \right] = G - (V \setminus X)$ where $X \subseteq V$.
Alternatively, this is called the subgraph induced by $X$.

Given $G = (V, E)$ and $F \subseteq E$, the

   \uuline{Lemma (part 1)}: If $G = (V, E)$ is a graph of minimum degree
   $k \geq 2$, then $G$ contains a cycle of length at least
   $k + 1$.

   {\exPOldd \begin{myConstrict}
      Proof: Let $P$ be a longest possible path in $G$, say:
      \[V(P) = \{v_1, v_2, \ldots, v_r\}\]

      Then $N(v_r) \subseteq V(P)$. After all, if this were not 
      the case, we'd be able to extend the path to the vertex in 
      $N(v_r)$ but not in $V(P)$, thus contradicting the fact that
      $P$ is a longest path. \retTwo

      Let $v_i$ be the first neighbor of $v_r$ along the path from
      $v_1$ to $v_r$. Then $\{v_i, v_{i+1}, \ldots, v_r\}$ are the
      vertices of a cycle $C$. \retTwo

      Now note that because $N(v_r) \subseteq P$ and $v_i$ was
      the first element in the path $P$ to belong to $N(v_r)$, 
      we know that $C$ contains all the elements of $P$ that 
      $N(v_r)$ also has. So, $N(v_r) \subseteq C$. \retTwo

      But now note that $\lvert N(v_r) \rvert \geq \delta(G)=k$. Plus,
      $v_r$ itself is not in $N(v_r)$. Combining these facts together,
      we can say that the cycle $C$ has at least $k + 1$ vertices.
   \end{myConstrict}}

   \uuline{Lemma (part 2)}: The cycle length $k+1$ is the longest 
   we can guarentee based on the minimum degree of the graph being $k$.

   {\exPOldd \begin{myConstrict}
      Proof: Take the graph $K_{k+1}$ which has a minimum degree $k$. 
      \newline
      Obviously, the longest cycle in $K_{k+1}$ is the cycle containing
      all $k+1$ elements of $K_{k+1}$. Thus, we have shown that there
      are graphs with minimum degree $k$ which don't have cycles of
      length greater than \newline $k + 1$.

         \hThreeOld
         \begin{myConstrict}
            Proof: We shall proceed by induction. \retTwo
            
            If $n = 1$, the tree is $K_1$, meaning that it has $0=n-1$
            edges. \retTwo

            Now assume the lemma is true for all trees with $n$
            vertices, and let $T$ be a tree with $n+1$ vertices. Then,
            we shall remove a vertex $v$ of $T$ with degree $1$. 
            (Note that we know such a vertex must exist since 
            otherwise the minimum degree of $T$ would be 
            at least $2$ and that would guarentee a cycle exists 
            of at least length 3. This
            of course contradicts the fact that $T$ is acyclic.)
            \retTwo 
            Then $T - \{v\}$ is a tree with $n$ vertices as it must be acyclic and connected. 
            So by induction it has $n-1$ edges. And because
            $v$ has degree $1$, we know that \newline $\lvert E(T) \rvert
            = 1 + \lvert E(T - \{v\}) \rvert = 1 + (n - 1) = n$.

            $e \in E(C)$, we have that $G - \{e\}$ is still connected.
            So, we can now go back to the top of the proof and ask:
            does $G -\{e\}$ have any cycles? We can repeatedly do this
            until the graph has no cycles since taking away edges
            does not remove any vertices.

Let $d_G(u, v)$ be the distance between $u$ and $v$.\retTwo

Distance is a \udefine{metric}, meaning:
\begin{myIndent}\begin{myIndent}\begin{enumerate}
   \item $d_G(u, v)=0 \Longleftrightarrow u=v$
   \item $d_G(u, v)=d_G(v, u)$

      d_G(u, v) \leq d_G(u, w) + d_G(w, v)$
\end{enumerate}\end{myIndent}\end{myIndent} \retTwo

The \udefine{diameter} of a connected graph $G$ is the maximum distance
between any two vertices of $G$. Or in other words,
$\max\{d_G(u,v) \mid u,v\in  V(G)\}$. \retTwo

The \udefine{radius} of $G$ is equal to 
   $ \min\{\max\{d_g(u,v) \mid u\in V(G)\} \mid v\in V(G)\} $. What
   that means is that the radius of $G$ measures the smallest distance
   path one could limit themselves to drawing while still being able
   to have that path have one end at some fixed vertex and its other
   end at any arbitrary vertex in the graph.


\begin{myIndent}
   \hTwoOldd \uuline{Examples}:
   \begin{enumerate}
      \item The radius of $K_n$  is $1$. The diameter of $K_n$ is $n$.
      \retTwo
      \item The diameter of $P_k$ is $k$. The radius, can be computed as
         follows:
         \begin{myIndent} \hFourOldd
            The middle vertex of a path will have the fastest access
            to either end of the path. So, we shall measure the radius
            from the vertex: $v_{\lceil \frac{k+1}{2} \rceil}$. Then,
            we can see that $v_{k+1}$ is going to be a farthest element
            from $v_{\lceil \frac{k+1}{2} \rceil}$. So the radius
            of $P_k$ equals $k + \lceil \frac{k+1}{2} \rceil$.
            \retTwo

            Now you can consider what happens when $k$ is even and odd.
            But what's \\important is that it works out that the radius
            is $\lceil \frac{k}{2} \rceil$.

      Here's how to find a spanning tree in a connected graph with a root
      vertex $v$ such that the tree "preserves" all distances
      from $v$.
      (This tree is called a \udefine{BFS tree}).
      \begin{myIndent} \hThreeOld
         Let $G$ be a connected graph and let $(v_1, v_2, v_3,
         \ldots, v_n)$ be any ordering of the vertices of $G$.
         \retTwo
         Pick a vertex $v=v_1$ to be the root of the BFS tree.
         \retTwo
         Now, at any stage in constructing this tree, we will have
         a vertex set $V(T) = \{v_1, v_2 \ldots, v_k\}$ (when we first
         start, $V(T)$ will only contain $v_0$. So don't worry about that).
         Now if $V(T)=V(G)$ we can stop. Otherwise though, we can say 
         that there is a smallest integer $i$ such that for $v_i \in V(T)$, 
         $\hspace{0.25em} N(v_i)\setminus V(T) \neq \emptyset$.
         Choose $v_{k+1}$ to be the smallest neighbor (by the ordering of $V(G)$) of $v_i$ 
         not in $T$ and add 
         the edge $\{v_i, v_{k+1}\}$ to $T$. Then we repeat this paragraph.
         \retTwo
         Beware the ordering we are creating in our tree will often
         be different from the order of the graph you started with.

Note that a tree is "minimally connecting" as subtracting any edge from a tree will produce a disconnected graph.
\begin{myIndent}
   We know this is the case because if we could remove an edge and still have the graph be connected, then that would imply the existence of a path between two neighboring vertices that doesn't go through their shared edge. But then, we'd be able to make a cycle subgraph by adding their shared edge to that path.

   \uuline{Theorem}: A graph is bipartite if and only if it contains no odd cycles.

   {\hThree
   \begin{myIndent}
      Proof: \\($\Longrightarrow$) First note that an odd cycle isn't bipartite. Thus, any graph containing an odd cycle is not bipartite. \retTwo

      ($\Longleftarrow$) Now supposed we are given some graph $G$ with no odd cycles. \\
      Then, assuming $G$ is connected (if $G$ isn't connected, we can break $G$ up into its component subgraphs and do this process for each component), we can construct a BFS-tree in $G$ rooted at some $v\in V(G)$. Let us name this tree $T$.
      \newpage

      Now as noted before, $T$ will have layers $L_i$ where each \\ $L_i=\{u\in V(G) \mid d_G(v, u)=i\}$. Using those layers, we can partition $T$ into two subsets $A$ and $B$ where $A$ is the union of all $L_i$ where $i$ is even and $B$ is the union of all $L_j$ where $j$ is odd. So, $T$ is clearly bipartite.
      \retTwo

      Now, let's reinsert the removed edges from $G$ back into $T$. Note that for each re-inserted edge $e$, it must be the case that either $e$ is a subset of some $L_i$ or that $e$ goes between some $L_i$ and $L_{i+1}$. Importantly, edges of the latter case do not violate our partition. So, if all the edges in $E(G) \setminus E(T)$ go between layers, then we can conclude that $G$ is definitely bipartite just like $T$.
      \retTwo

      With that, we now intend to show that an edge $G$ having an edge belonging to a single layer $L_i$ guarentees that $G$ contains an odd cycle.
      {\begin{myIndent} \hFour
         Assume the graph $G$ has an edge $\{u, w\}\subseteq L_i$ where $L_i$ is the $i$th layer of a BFS tree rooted at $v$. Then, we know that there exists a path $P_1$ contained in that BFS tree going from $v$ to $u$ and a path $P_2$ contained in that BFS tree going from $v$ to $w$. In order to draw a cycle from this information, let $x$ be the vertex of some $L_j$ such that $x\in V(P_1)$, $x\in V(P_2)$, and $j$ is as large as possible. That way, by defining the subpaths ${P_1}^\prime$ going from $x$ to $u$ and ${P_2}^\prime$ going from $x$ to $w$, we can get the following cyclic subgraph of $G$ :\[ C=(V({P_1}^\prime)\cup V({P_2}^\prime), E({P_1}^\prime)\cup E({P_2}^\prime) \cup \{u, w\})\]

         However, now note that $\lvert E({P_1}^\prime) \rvert = \lvert E({P_2}^\prime) \rvert = i-j$. Hence, \\$\lvert E(C) \rvert = 2(i-j)+1$, which in turn means that $C$ has an odd number of edges. So, we have shown that if a graph $G$ contains an edge within a single layer $L_i$, then we can give an example of an odd cycle within $G$. \retTwo
      \end{myIndent}}

      So in conclusion, if we assume $G$ has no odd cycles, then $G$ can't have any edges which are subsets of a single layer $L_i$. But that means that every edge in $G$ respects the partition we made to show that $T$ is bipartite. So, $G$ must also be bipartite with the same partition as $T$. $\blacksquare$

\markLecture{1/18/2024}

Before finding conditions for the existence of an eulerian tour of a graph, let's \\establish some terminology for digraphs so that we can study Eulerian tours in \\digraphs as well. \retTwo

Firstly, a walk, trail, and tour are defined almost identically in a digraph as in a graph. The one difference is that given some edge $(u, v)$ of a digraph, a walk, trail, and path are only allowed to traverse that edge going from $u$ to $v$. \retTwo

Given a digraph $(V, E)$, the "out" and "in" neighborhoods of a vertex $v \in V$ are:
\begin{myIndent}
   \begin{itemize}
      \item[{\color{BrickRed}out:}] $N^+(v)=\{w\in V \mid (v, w) \in E\}$
      \item[{\color{BrickRed}\phantom{o}in:}] $N^-(v)=\{w\in V \mid (w, v) \in E\}$
   \end{itemize}
\end{myIndent} \retTwo

Similarly, the out-degree and in-degree of $v \in V$ are:
\begin{myIndent}
   \begin{itemize}
      \item[{\color{BrickRed}out:}] $d^+(v)=\lvert N^+(v) \rvert$
      \item[{\color{BrickRed}\phantom{o}in:}] $d^-(v)=\lvert N^-(v) \rvert$
   \end{itemize}
\end{myIndent} \retTwo

A digraph is called \udefine{Eulerian} if for each vertex $v \hspace{0.25em}$, $d^+(v)=d^-(v)$.

   \begin{enumerate}
      \item A graph has an Eulerian tour if and only if it is connected and Eulerian.
      \item A digraph has an Eulerian tour if and only if it has a connected underlying graph and if it is Eulerian. \retTwo
   \end{enumerate}

   \hThree
   Proof of statement 1:
   \begin{myIndent}
      ($\Longrightarrow$) If $G$ has an Eulerian tour $v_0 e_0 v_1 e_1 v_2 e_2 \ldots v_k e_k v_0$, then for any $v_i$, the tour has to use an edge into $v_i$ and an edge out of $v_i$ each time it visits $v_i$. So, $d(v_i)$ is even for all $i$. \retTwo

      ($\Longleftarrow$) Now suppose $G$ is connected and all vertices have even degree. Then let $T=v_0 e_0 v_1 e_1 v_2 e_2 \ldots v_l e_l v_{l+1}$ be a longest trail in $G$. \retTwo
      
      If $v_{l+1} \neq v_0$, then we know that $v_{l+1}$ has an odd degree in $T$ as the trail goes into $v_{l+1}$ and doesn't leave. However, because we assumed that all vertices in $G$ have an even degree, we know there must be an even number of edges coming out of $v_{l+1}$. So, we can add another edge to our trail to get a longer trail. But this contradicts our assumption that $T$ is a longest trail in $G$. Hence, we conclude that $v_{l+1} = v_0$, meaning $T$ is a tour.\retTwo
      
      Now consider if $T$ is not an Eulerian tour. In that case, there is an edge of $G$ not in $T$. Additionally, because $G$ is connected, we know that that edge will have the form $e = \{v_i, w\}$. So now consider a new trail: $T^\prime$ defined as $v_i e_i v_{i+1} e_{i+1} \ldots v_0 e_0 v_1 e_1 \ldots v_i e w$. Importantly, $T^\prime$ is a longer trail than $T$. So we have a contradiction as $T$ is not a longest trail. \retTwo

      Therefore, the longest trail $T$ in $G$ must be an Eulerian tour. \retTwo

   The proof of statement 2 is nearly identical. \retTwo

   {\begin{myIndent} \hThree
      Proof:\\ Suppose the theorem is false. Let $G$ be a counter-example with as many edges as possible (a maximal counter-example). Then, we know there exists an edge $\{u, v\} \notin E(G)$ as $G$ cannot equal $K_n$ since $K_n$ is hamiltonian. Furthermore, we know that $G + \{u, v\}$ is hamiltonian since $G$ was maximal. So, there is a hamiltonian cycle $C \subseteq G + \{u, v\}$ using the edge $\{u, v\}$. This in  turn means that $C - \{u, v\}$ is a hamiltonian path belonging to $G$.
      \retTwo

      Let $P=v_1e_1v_2e_2\ldots e_nv_n$ be the hamiltonian path in $G$ from $u$ to $v$ and let $N^+(w)$ denote the set of vertices immediately following a neighbor of $w$ on the path $P$. In other words: $N^+(w) = \{v_{i+1} \mid v_i \in N_G(w)\}$. \retTwo

      By the theorem's assumption about the minimum degree of the graph,\\ we know that $\left| N_G(u) \right| \geq \frac{n}{2}$. Meanwhile on the other end of $P$, since\\ $v=v_n \notin N_G(v)$, we know that every neighbor of $v$ has an element\\ following it on the path. So $\left| N^+(v) \right| \geq \frac{n}{2}$. Thus $\left| N_G(u) \right| + \left| N^+(v) \right| \geq n$.\\ But now note that $u$ does not belong to either of the above sets. So\\ $\left| N_G(u) \cup N^+(v) \right| \leq n-1$. As a consequence of this, $\left| N_G(u) \cap N^+(v) \right| > 0$. 
      
      \newpage

      Let $v_i$ be a vertex belonging to $(N_G(v) \cap N^+(u))$. Then we can draw a cycle in $G$ visiting all the vertices of $G$ in the following order: \[v_1, v_2, \ldots, v_{i-1}, v_n, v_{n-1}, \ldots, v_i, v_1\]

      This contradicts our assumption that $G$ would be a counter example and thus not Hamiltonian. So, we assume no such counter example exists. \retTwo
   \end{myIndent}}

   We can also show that Dirac's Theorem gives the best possible minimum degree for a graph to be guarenteably Hamiltonian. Consider a graph $G$ containing two copies of $K_m$ sharing exactly one vertex. In that case, $n = \left| V(G) \right| = 2m - 1$ and\\ $\delta(G) = m-1 = \frac{n-1}{2}$. However, this graph does not have a spanning subcycle as any spanning cycle would have to cross that shared vertex twice. \retTwo

Let $P$ be a longest path in $G$ going from a vertex $u$ to a vertex $v$. Additionally, for any $w \in V(P)$, let $w^+$ be the vertex following $w$ as one travels from $u$ to $v$ along $P$. Importantly, since $P$ is a longest path, we know that $(N_G(u) \cup N_G(v)) \subseteq V(P)$. Furthermore, for each $w \in N_G(v)$, we can define $Q = P - \{w, w^+\} + \{v, w\}$ where $Q$ is a longest path of $G$ going from $u$ to $w^+$ instead of $u$ to $v$. We call $Q$ a \udefine{rotation} of $P$ at $v$.

   \uuline{Pósa's Rotation Lemma}: Suppose $G$ is a graph and for every $S \subseteq V(G)$ with $\left| S \right| \leq t$, $\left| N(S) \right| > 2 \left| S \right|$. Then $G$ contains a path of length $3t + 1$.

      Proof:\\ Let $P$ be a longest path ending at a vertex $v$. Also, let $S$ be the set of end \\vertices of all possible longest paths that could be obtained through any \\number of rotations starting with $P$. Finally, let $S^+$ and $S^-$ denoted the vertices of $P$ immediately after and immediately before vertices in $S$ respectively. \retTwo

      Obviously, $\lvert S^+ \rvert \leq \lvert S \rvert$ and $\lvert S^- \rvert \leq \lvert S \rvert$ as all vertices except the first and last vertex of $P$ have exactly one vertex before and after them in $P$. Also note that $N(S) \subseteq S^+ \cup S^-$. This is because if there did exist $w \in N(S)$ such that $w \notin S^+ \cup S^-$, then we would know that no rotation of $P$ made it so that $w$ was not proceeded by $w^-$ and followed by $w^+$. So, doing a rotation with the vertex $w$, we would show that either $w^+$ or $w^-$ belonged to $S$, thus reaching a contradiction. 
      \newpage

      Overall, this means that $\lvert N(S) \rvert \leq \lvert S^+ \cup S^- \rvert \leq \lvert S^+ \rvert + \lvert S^- \rvert \leq 2 \lvert S \rvert$.\\ However, note that by the theorem's assumption about $G$, we know that $\left|S\right| \geq t$ because otherwise we'd have that $ 2\left| S \right| < \left|N(S)\right|$. So, let $T$ be a subset of $S$ such that $\left| T \right| = t$. Then, because $T$ and $N(T)$ are disjoint\\ subsets of $(S \cup N(S))$ which itself is a subset of $V(P)$, we know that\\ $\left| V(P) \right| \geq \left| T \right| + \left| N(T) \right|$. And since $\left| N(T) \right| > 2\left| T \right| = 2t$ by the theorem's assumption about $G$, we thus can say that $\left| V(P) \right| > 3t$. $\blacksquare$ \retTwo
