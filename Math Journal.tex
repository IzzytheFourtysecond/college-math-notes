   My goal for today is to work through the appendix to chapter 1 in Baby Rudin. This appendix focuses on constructing the real numbers using Dedikind cuts.\retTwo
   
   \hTwo
   \begin{myIndent}
      We define a \udefine{cut} to be a set $\alpha \subset \mathbb{Q}$ such that:
      \begin{enumerate}
         \item $\alpha \neq \emptyset$
         \item If $p \in \alpha$,\myHS $q \in \mathbb{Q}$, and $q < p$, then $q \in \alpha$.
         \item If $p \in \alpha$, then $p < r$ for some $r \in \alpha$\newline
      \end{enumerate}

      Point 3 tells us that $\alpha$ doesn't have a max element. Also, point 2 directly implies the following facts:
      \begin{itemize}
         \item[a.] If $p \in \alpha$,\myHS $q \in \mathbb{Q}$, and $q \notin \alpha$, then $q > p$.
         \item[b.] If $r \notin \alpha$,\myHS $r, s \in \mathbb{Q}$, and $r < s$, then $s \notin \alpha$.\newline
      \end{itemize}

      As a shorthand, I shall refer to the set of all cuts as $R$.
      \begin{myIndent}\myComment
         An example of a cut would be the set of rational numbers less than $2$.\\
      \end{myIndent}

      Firstly, we shall assign an ordering to $R$. Specifically, given any $\alpha, \beta \in R$, we say that $\alpha < \beta$ if $\alpha \subset \beta$ (a proper subset).

      \begin{myIndent}\exTwo
         Here we prove that $<$ satisfies the definition of an ordering.
         \begin{itemize}
            \item[\mRoman{1}.] It's obvious from the definition of a proper subset that at most one of the following three things can be true: $\alpha < \beta$,\myHS $\alpha = \beta$, and $\beta < \alpha$.\retTwo
            
            Now let's assume that $a \not< \beta$ and $\alpha \not= \beta$. Then $\exists p \in \alpha$ such that $p \notin \beta$. But then for any $q \in \beta$, we must have by fact b. above that $q < p$. Hence $q \in \alpha$, meaning that $\beta \subset \alpha$. This proves that at least one of the following has to be true: $\alpha < \beta$,\myHS $\alpha = \beta$, and $\beta < \alpha$.\retTwo

            \item[\mRoman{2}.] If for $\alpha, \beta, \gamma \in R$ we have that $\alpha < \beta$ and $\beta < \gamma$, then clearly $\alpha < \gamma$ becuase $\alpha \subset \beta \subset \gamma$.\retTwo
         \end{itemize}
      \end{myIndent}

      Now we claim that $R$ equipped with $<$ has the least-upper-bound property.
      \begin{myIndent}\exTwo
         Proof:\\
         Let $A \subset R$ be nonempty and $\beta \in R$ be an upper bound of $A$. Then set\\ $\gamma = \hspace{-0.2em}\bigcup\limits_{\alpha \in A}\hspace{-0.2em}\alpha$. Firstly, we want to show that $\gamma \in R$\retTwo

         Since $A \neq \emptyset$, there exists $\alpha_0 \in A$. And as $\alpha_0 \neq \emptyset$ and $\alpha_0 \subseteq \gamma$ by definition, we know that $\gamma \neq \emptyset$. At the same time, we know that $\gamma \subset \beta$ since $\forall \alpha \in A$,\myHS $\alpha \subset \beta$. Hence, $\gamma \neq \mathbb{Q}$, meaning that $\gamma$ satisfies property 1$.$ of cuts.\retTwo

         Next, let $p \in \gamma$ and $q \in \mathbb{Q}$ such that $q < p$. We know that for some $\alpha_1 \in A$, we have that $p \in \alpha_1$. Hence by property 2$.$ of cuts, we know that $q \in \alpha_1 \subset \gamma$, thus showing that $\gamma$ satisfies property 2$.$ of cuts.\newpage
         
         Thirdly, by property 3$.$ we can pick $r \in \alpha_1$ such that $p < r$ and $r \in \alpha_1 \subset \gamma$. So, $\gamma$ satisfies property 3$.$ of cuts.\retTwo

         With that, we've now shown that $\gamma \in R$. Clearly, $\gamma$ is an upper bound of $A$ since $\alpha \subset \gamma$ for all $\alpha \in A$. Meanwhile, consider any $\delta < \gamma$. Then $\exists s \in \gamma$ such that $s \notin \delta$. And since $s \in \gamma$, we know that $s \in \alpha$ for some $\alpha \in A$. Hence, $\delta < \alpha$, meaning that $\delta$ is not an upper bound of $A$. This shows that $\gamma = \sup A$.\\ [6pt]
      \end{myIndent}

      Secondly, we want to assign $+$ and $\hspace{0.1em}\cdot\hspace{0.1em}$ operations to $R$ so that $R$ is an ordered field.\retTwo
      
      To start, given any $\alpha, \beta \in R$, we shall define $\alpha + \beta$ to be the set of all sums $r + s$ such that $r \in \alpha$ and $s \in \beta$.
      \begin{myIndent}\exTwo
         Here we show that $\alpha + \beta \in R$.
         \begin{enumerate}
            \item Clearly, $\alpha + \beta \neq \emptyset$. Also, take $r^\prime \notin \alpha$ and $s^\prime \notin \beta$. Then $r^\prime + s^\prime > r + s$ for all $r \in \alpha$ and $s \in \beta$. Hence, $r^\prime + s^\prime \notin \alpha + \beta$, meaning that $\alpha + \beta \neq \mathbb{Q}$.\\ [-9pt]
         \end{enumerate}

         Now let $p \in \alpha + \beta$. Thus there exists $r \in \alpha$ and $s \in \beta$ such that $p = r + s$.\\ [-9pt]

         \begin{enumerate}
            \item[2.] Suppose $q < p$. Then $q - s < r$, meaning that $q - s \in \alpha$. Hence,\\ $q = (q - s) + s \in \alpha + \beta$.\retTwo
            
            \item[3.] Let $t \in \alpha$ so that $t > r$. Then $p = r + s < t + s$ and $t + s \in \alpha + \beta$.\retTwo
         \end{enumerate}
      \end{myIndent}

      Also, we shall define $0^*$ to be the set of all negative rational numbers. Clearly, $0^*$ is a cut. Furthermore, we claim that $+$ satisfies the addition requirements of a field with $0^*$ as its $0$ element.

      \begin{myIndent}\exTwo
         Commutativity and associativity of $+$ on $R$ follows directly from the\\ commutativity and associativity of addition on the rational numbers.\retTwo

         Also, for any $\alpha \in R$,\myHS $\alpha + 0^* = \alpha$.
         \begin{myIndent}\exP
            If $r \in \alpha$ and $s \in 0^*$, then $r + s < r$. Hence $r + s \in \alpha$, meaning that $\alpha + 0^* \subseteq \alpha$. Meanwhile, if $p \in \alpha$, then we can pick $r \in \alpha$ such that $r > p$. Then, $p - r \in 0^*$ and $p = r + (p - r) \in \alpha + 0^*$. So, $\alpha \subseteq \alpha + 0^*$.\retTwo
         \end{myIndent}

         Finally, given any $\alpha \in R$, let $\beta = \{p \in \mathbb{Q} \mid \exists\hspace{0.1em} r \in \mathbb{Q}^+ \suchthat -p-r \notin \alpha\}$.
         \begin{myIndent}\myComment
            To give some intuition on this definition, firstly we want to guarentee that for all $p \in \beta$, $-p$ is greater than all elements of $\alpha$. Secondly, we add the $-r$ term to guarentee that $\beta$ doesn't have a maximum element.\\
         \end{myIndent}

         We claim that $\beta \in R$ and $\beta + \alpha = 0^*$. Hence, we can define $-\alpha = \beta$.

         \begin{myIndent}\exP
            To start, we'll show that $\beta \in R$:
            \begin{enumerate}
               \item For $s \notin \alpha$ and $p = -s - 1$, we have that $-p - 1 \notin \alpha$. Hence, $p \in \beta$, meaning that $\beta \neq \emptyset$. Meanwhile, if $q \in \alpha$, then $-q \notin \beta$ because there does not exist $r > 0$ such that $-(-q) - r = q - r \notin \alpha$. So $\beta \neq \mathbb{Q}$.\\ [-6pt]
            \end{enumerate}

            Now let $p \in \beta$ and pick $r > 0$ such that $-p -r \notin \alpha$.\newpage

            \begin{enumerate}
               \item[2.] Suppose $q < p$. Then $-q - r > -p - r$, meaning that $-q - r \notin \alpha$. Hence, $q \in \beta$.\retTwo
               
               \item[3.] Let $t = p + \frac{r}{2}$. Then $t > p$ and $-t - \frac{r}{2} = -p - r \notin \alpha$, meaning $t \in \beta$.\retTwo
            \end{enumerate}

            Now that we've proved $\beta \in R$, we next prove that $\beta$ is the additive inverse of $\alpha$. To start, suppose $r \in \alpha$ and $s \in \beta$. Then $-s \notin \alpha$, meaning that $r < -s$. So $r + s < 0$, thus showing that $\alpha + \beta \subseteq 0^*$.\retTwo

            As for the other inclusion, pick any $v \in 0^*$ and set $w = -\frac{v}{2}$. Then because $w > 0$, we can use the archimedean property of $\mathbb{Q}$ to say that there exists $n \in \mathbb{Z}$ such that $nw \in \alpha$ but $(n+1)w \notin \alpha$. Put $p = -(n + 2)w$. Then $p \in \beta$ because $-p - w = (n+1)w
            \notin \alpha$. And finally, $v = nw + p \in \alpha + \beta$. Thus, $0^* \subseteq \alpha + \beta$.\retTwo
         \end{myIndent}
      \end{myIndent}
   \end{myIndent}
   \dispDate{9/1/2024}
   \begin{myIndent}\hTwo
      Based on the definition of $+$, it's also hopefully clear that for any $\alpha, \beta, \gamma \in R$ such that $\alpha < \beta$, we have that $\alpha + \gamma < \beta + \gamma$.\retTwo

      Next, we shall define multiplication on $R$. Except, first we're going to limit ourselves to the set $R^+$ of all cuts greater than $0^*$. So, given any $\alpha, \beta \in R^+$, we shall define $\alpha \beta$ to be the set of all $p \in \mathbb{Q}$ such that $p \leq rs$ where $r \in \alpha$,\myHS $s \in \beta$,\myHS $r > 0$, and $s > 0$.

      \begin{myIndent}\exTwo
         Here we show that $\alpha\beta \in R^+$.
         \begin{enumerate}
            \item Clearly $\alpha\beta \neq \emptyset$. Also, take any $r^\prime \notin \alpha$ and $s^\prime \notin \beta$. Then $r^\prime s^\prime > rs$ for all $r \in \alpha \cap \mathbb{Q}^+$ and $s \in \beta \cap \mathbb{Q}^+$ since all four rational numbers are positive. By extension, $r^\prime s^\prime$ is greater than all the elements (both positive and negative) of $\alpha\beta$. So, $r^\prime s^\prime \notin \alpha\beta$, meaning that $\alpha\beta \neq \mathbb{Q}$.\\ [-9pt]
         \end{enumerate}

         Now let $p \in \alpha\beta$. Based on our definition of $\alpha\beta$, we know that the conditions of a cut trivially hold for any negative $p$. So, we'll assume from now on that $p > 0$. (Also note that a positive choice of $p$ must exist because both $\alpha$ and $\beta$ by assumption have positive elements.)\retTwo

         Since $p \in \alpha\beta \cap \mathbb{Q}^+$, we know there exists $r \in \alpha$ and $s \in \beta$ such that $p = rs$ and $r, s > 0$.

         \begin{enumerate}
            \item[2.] Suppose $0 < q < p$ (the case where $q \leq 0$ is trivial). Then $\frac{q}{s} < r$, meaning that $\frac{q}{s} \in \alpha$. So, $q = \frac{q}{s} \cdot s \in \alpha\beta$.\retTwo
            
            \item[3.] Let $t \in \alpha$ so that $t > r$. Then $p = rs < ts$ and $ts \in \alpha\beta$.\retTwo
         \end{enumerate}
      \end{myIndent}

      Also, we shall define $1^*$ to be the set of all rational numbers less than $1$. Clearly, $1^*$ is a cut. And we claim that $\hspace{0.1em}\cdot\hspace{0.1em}$ satisfies the multiplication requirements of a field with $1^*$ as its $1$ element.\newpage

      \begin{myIndent}\exTwo
         As before, commutativity and associativity of $\hspace{0.1em}\cdot\hspace{0.1em}$ on $R^+$ follows directly from commutativity and associativity of multiplication on the rational numbers.\retTwo

         Next, for any $\alpha \in R^+$, we have that $\alpha 1^* = \alpha$.
         \begin{myIndent}\exP
            It's clear that for any rational number $r \leq 0$, we have that $r \in \alpha 1^*$ and $r \in \alpha$. So we can exclusively focus on positive rational numbers.\retTwo
            
            Now suppose $r \in \alpha \cap \mathbb{Q}^+$ and $s \in 1^*$. Then $rs < r$, meaning that $rs \in \alpha$. So $\alpha 1^* \subseteq \alpha$. Meanwhile, if $p \in \alpha \cap \mathbb{Q}^+$, then we can pick $r \in \alpha$ such that $r > p$. Then $\frac{p}{r} \in 1^*$ and $p = \frac{p}{r} \cdot r \in \alpha 1^*$. So, $\alpha \subseteq \alpha 1^*$.\retTwo
         \end{myIndent}

         Thirdly, given any $\alpha \in R^+$, define:

         \begin{centering}
            $\beta = \{p \in \mathbb{Q} \mid p \leq 0\} \cup \{p \in \mathbb{Q}^+ \mid \exists r \in \mathbb{Q}^+ \suchthat \frac{1}{q} - r \notin \alpha\}$\retTwo\par
         \end{centering}

         \begin{myIndent}\exP
            Here we show that $\beta \in R^+$.
            \begin{enumerate}
               \item Clearly $\beta \neq \emptyset$. Also, if $q \in \alpha$, then $\frac{1}{q} \notin \beta$. Hence, $\beta \neq \mathbb{Q}$.\retTwo
            \end{enumerate}

            Now let $p \in \beta$ and pick $r > 0$ such that $\frac{1}{p} - r \notin \alpha$. Also, assume $p > 0$ because the proof is trivial if $p \leq 0$. (The fact that $p > 0$ in $\beta$ exists is trivial to show.)\retTwo

            \begin{enumerate}
               \item[2.] If $q \leq 0 < p$, then trivially $q \in \beta$. Meanwhile, if $0 < q < p$, then\\ [2pt] $\frac{1}{q} - r > \frac{1}{p} - r$, meaning that $\frac{1}{q} - r \notin \alpha$. Hence, $q \notin \beta$.\retTwo
               
               \item[3.] Let $t = \frac{1}{\frac{1}{p} - \frac{r}{2}}$. Then since $\frac{1}{p} - r \notin \alpha$, we know that $\frac{1}{p} - \frac{r}{2} > 0$. Also since $\frac{1}{t} = \frac{1}{p} - \frac{r}{2} < \frac{1}{p}$, we have that $t > p$. But note that $\frac{1}{t} - \frac{r}{2} = \frac{1}{p} - r \notin \alpha$.\\[2pt] Hence $t \notin \beta$.\retTwo
            \end{enumerate}
         \end{myIndent}

         We claim that $\beta\alpha = 1^*$. Hence, we can define $\frac{1}{\alpha} = \beta$.

         \begin{myIndent}\exP
            To start, suppose $r \in \alpha \cap \mathbb{Q}^+$ and $s \in \beta \cap \mathbb{Q}^+$. Then $\frac{1}{s} \notin \alpha$, meaning that\\ $r < \frac{1}{s}$. So $rs < 1$, thus showing that $\alpha\beta \subseteq 1^*$.\retTwo

            The other inclusion has a more complicated proof. Firstly, take any\\ $v \in 1^* \cap \mathbb{Q}^+$ (the proof is trivial if $v \leq 0$). Then set $w = \frac{1}{v}$, meaning\\ that $w > 1$. Now since $\alpha \in R^+$, we know there exists $n \in \mathbb{Z}$ such that\\ $w^n \in \alpha$ but $w^{n+1} \notin \alpha$. Then as $w^{n+2} > w^{n+1}$, we know that $\frac{1}{w^{n+2}} \in \beta$.\\ Hence, $v^2 = w^n \frac{1}{w^{n+2}} \in \alpha\beta$.\retTwo

            Now that we've shown that the square of every $v \in 1^* \cap \mathbb{Q}^+$ is also in $\alpha\beta$,\\ [2pt] we next show that there exists $z \in 1^* \cap \mathbb{Q}^+$ such that $z^2 > v$. Suppose $v = \frac{p}{q}$ where $p, q \in \mathbb{Z}^+$. Then set $z = \frac{p + q}{2q}$. Importantly, since $p < q$, we still have that $z \in 1^*$. But also note that:

            \begin{centering}
               $z^2 - v = \frac{p^2 + 2pq + q^2}{4q^2} - \frac{4pq}{4q^2} = \frac{p^2 - 2pq + q^2}{4q^2} = \left(\frac{p - q}{2q}\right)^2 \geq 0$\retTwo\par
            \end{centering}

            Thus as $v \leq z^2$ and $z^2 \in \alpha\beta$, we have that $v \in \alpha\beta$ as well. So $1^* \subseteq \alpha\beta$.\newpage
         \end{myIndent}

         Finally, so long as $\alpha, \beta, \gamma \in R^+$, we have that  $\alpha(\beta + \gamma) = \alpha\beta + \alpha\gamma$ because the rational numbers satisfy the distributive property.\retTwo
      \end{myIndent}

      Notably, in proving that $\alpha\beta \in R^+$ before, we also guarenteed that for $\alpha, \beta > 0$, we have that $\alpha\beta > 0$.\retTwo
   \end{myIndent} 

   \dispDate{9/7/2024}

   \begin{myIndent}

      Now we still need to extend our definition of multiplication from $R^+$ to all of $R$. To do this, set $\alpha 0^* = 0^*\alpha = 0^*$ and define:

      {\centering $\alpha \beta = \left\{
      \begin{matrix}
         (-\alpha)(-\beta) & \text{ if } \alpha < 0^*, \beta < 0^* \\
         -((-\alpha)\beta) & \text { if } \alpha < 0^*, \beta > 0^* \\
         -(\alpha(-\beta)) & \text{ if } \alpha > 0^*, \beta < 0^*
      \end{matrix}\right.$ \retTwo\par}

      Having done that, reproving those properties of multiplication on all of $R$ just\\ becomes a matter of addressing many cases and using the identity that\\ $(-(-\alpha)) = \alpha$.

      \begin{myIndent}\myComment
         Note that that identity can be proven just from the addition properties of a field.\retTwo
      \end{myIndent}

      Because I'm bored with this construction at this point, I'm going to skip reproving those properties.\retTwo

      So now that we've established that $R$ is a field, all we have left to do is to show that all numbers $r, s \in \mathbb{Q}$ are represented by cuts $r^*, s^* \in R$ such that:
      
      \begin{itemize}
         \item $(r + s)^* = r^* + s^*$
         \item $(rs)^* = r^*s^*$
         \item $r < s \Longleftrightarrow r^* < s^*$\retTwo
      \end{itemize}

      Again, I'm super bored and demotivated at this point. So, I'm going to skip showing this.\retTwo

      With all that done, we've now shown that $R$ satisfies all of the properties of real numbers. That concludes the proof of the existence theorem of the real numbers.

      Now, the textbook recommends defining $h: A \longrightarrow B$ by:

            f(x) & & \text{ if } x \in A_n - B_n \text{ for any } n \in \mathbb{Z}_+ \\
            x & & \text{ otherwise }
         \end{matrix}\right.$\newpage
      \end{center}

      
      \begin{myIndent}
         \myComment I want to ask a professor about this definition because it urks me. My issue with\\ this definition of $h$ is that I feel like it should be possible for:
         $$\bigcap\limits_{n=1}^\infty (A_n \cap B_n) \neq \emptyset.$$
         
         However, we wouldn't be able to know that some $x$ is in that intersection and\\ thus falls into case 2 until after an infinite number of steps.\retTwo
         
         On the other hand, $S_1 = \bigcup\limits_{n = 1}^\infty (A_n - B_n)$ is a valid definition for a set, as is\\ $S_2 = A - S_1$. So the definition $h$ is valid because it's saying that $h(x) = f(x)$\\ [6pt] if $x \in S_1$ and $h(x) = x$ if $x \in S_2$.\retTwo

         Maybe my issue is just that I have trouble trusting the validity of a function definition if I can't actually evaluate that function myself. Although, there are lots of functions like that that I don't have any problem with. For example, given $g(x) = 0$ if $x$ is rational and $g(x) = 1$ if $x$ is irrational, what is $g(\pi^2)$?\retTwo
      \end{myIndent}

      Hopefully it is clear that $h$ is in fact a valid function from $A$ to $B$. Now firstly, we shall show that $h$ is injective.

      \begin{myIndent}\exP
         Let $x, y \in A$ such that $x \neq y$. If there are integers $n$ and $m$ such that $x \in A_n - B_n$ and $y \in A_m - B_m$, then $h(x) \neq h(y)$ because $f$ is injective. Meanwhile, if no such $n$ or $m$ exists, then $h(x) \neq h(y)$ because $x \neq y$.\retTwo

         This leaves the case that there exists $n \in \mathbb{Z}_+$ such that $x \in A_n - B_n$ but for\\ all $m \in \mathbb{Z}_+,\myHS y \notin A_m - B_m$. Then, note that $f(x) \in f(A_{n} - B_{n})$. And since\\ $f$ is injective, we thus have that $f(x) \in f(A_{n}) - f(B_{n}) = A_{n+1} - B_{n+1}$.\\ Therefore, as $y \notin A_{n+1} - B_{n+1}$, we know that $h(x) \neq y = h(y)$.\retTwo
      \end{myIndent}

      Next, we show $h$ is surjective.

      \begin{myIndent}\exP
         Let $y \in B$.\retTwo
         
         Suppose there exists $n \in \mathbb{Z}_+$ such that $y \in A_n - B_n$. We know that $n \neq 1$ since $y \in B$. Thus, there must exist $x \in A_{n-1}$ such that $y = f(x) \in f(A_{n-1}) = A_n$. Furthermore, this $x$ can't be in $B_{n-1}$ because otherwise $y$ would be in $B_n$ which we know isn't true. So, $x \in A_{n-1} - B_{n-1}$, meaning that $h(x) = f(x) = y$.\retTwo

         Meanwhile, if no such $n$ exists, then we simply have that $h(y) = y$. Hence,\\ $h(A) = B$.\retTwo
      \end{myIndent}

      Thus, we've shown that $h$ is a bijection, meaning that $|A| = |B|$.\newpage

   \blab{Exercise 7.7:} Show that $|\{0, 1\}^\omega| = |(\mathbb{Z}_+)^\omega|$.

   
   \begin{myIndent}\exTwo
      Firstly, obviously a bijection exists between $\{0, 1\}^\omega$ and $\{1, 2\}^\omega$. Also,\\ $\{1, 2\}^\omega \subset (\mathbb{Z}_+)^\omega$. So, if we can construct an injective function from $(\mathbb{Z}_+)^\omega$\\ to $\{1, 2\}^\omega$, then we can apply the result of exercise 7.6.a to prove this\\ exercise's claim.\retTwo

      We shall create this injection using a diagonalization argument. Let $x \in (\mathbb{Z}_+)^\omega$.\\ Then we define $f(x) = y \in \{1, 2\}^\omega$ as follows:
      
      \begin{center}
         \begin{tabular}{c}
            $y(1) = 2$ if $x(1) = 1$. Otherwise $y(1) = 1$.\\ [6pt]

            $y(3) = 2$ if $x(2) = 1$. Otherwise $y(3) = 1$.\\ [6pt]
            $y(4) = 2$ if $x(1) = 3$. Otherwise $y(4) = 1$.\\
            $y(5) = 2$ if $x(2) = 2$. Otherwise $y(5) = 1$.\\
            $y(6) = 2$ if $x(3) = 1$. Otherwise $y(6) = 1$. \\ [6pt]

         We know $i \neq 1$ because $f(1) = a_0 = g(1)$. But then note that\\ $f|_{\{1, \ldots, i - 1\}} = g|_{\{1, \ldots, i- 1\}}$. Hence:

   \begin{myIndent}\myComment
      A few notes:
      \begin{enumerate}
         \item If we restrict $\mathcal{A}$ to being a finite collection, then there is nothing controversial about this axiom. It only becomes controversial when $\mathcal{A}$ is allowed to be infinite.
         \item There are multiple instances in baby Rudin where we made an infinite number of\\ arbitrary choices. Looking at a lot of those proofs closer, I think many of them could avoid using the axiom of choice by specifying that we had to pick rational numbers in a set. However, being able to pick elements without worrying about a preexisting choice function is way easier.\retTwo
         
         My take away from this is that not only does it make proofs cleaner to not worry about using constructed choice functions, but it's also perfectly acceptable now-a-days to use this axiom.\newpage
         
         Plus, some really commonly used theorems require the axiom of choice to prove them. For example, the union of countably many countable sets being countable. This makes it really easy to accidentally use the axiom of choice in a proof.\retTwo

   \begin{myIndent}\hTwo
      Proof:\\
      Given any set $B \in \mathcal{B}$, we define $B^\prime = \{(B, b) \mid b \in B\}$. Because $B \neq \emptyset$, we know that $B^\prime \neq \emptyset$ as well. Furthermore, given $B_1, B_2 \in \mathcal{B}$ if $B_1 \neq B_2$, then we have that the first element of all the pairs in $B_1^\prime$ are different from that of $B_2^\prime$. So $B_1^\prime$ and $B_2^\prime$ are disjoint.\retTwo

      Now form the collection $\mathcal{C} = \{B^\prime \mid B \in \mathcal{B}\}$. From before, we know that $\mathcal{C}$ is\\ a collection of disjoint sets. So by the axiom of choice, there exists a set $c$\\ consisting of exactly one element from each element of $\mathcal{C}$.\retTwo

But then that shows that $k + 1 \notin S$ since otherwise $k + 1$ would be the least element of $S$. Furthermore, since no element of $\{1, \ldots, k\}$ is in $S$, we automatically have that $k + 1 \in R$.\retTwo

         By induction, this means that $R = \mathbb{Z}_+$. Hence, we get a contradiction as $S$ must be empty.\newpage

         ($\Longleftarrow$)\\
         Let $S$ be a subset of $\mathbb{Z}_+$ such that $1 \in S$ and $k \in S \Longrightarrow k + 1 \in S$. Then suppose that $S \neq \mathbb{Z}_+$. In that case, we know that $S^\comp \neq \emptyset$, and since $\mathbb{Z}_+$ is well-ordered, we know there is a least element $\alpha$ of $S^\comp$.\retTwo

         Because $1 \in S$, we know that $\alpha \geq 2$. But then consider that $1 \leq \alpha - 1 < \alpha$. Therefore, $\alpha - 1 \in S$, thus implying that $\alpha \in S$. This contradicts that $\alpha \in S^\comp$.\retTwo

   Facts:
   \begin{itemize}
      \item If $A$ with the order relation $<$ is well-ordered, then any subset of $A$ is well-\\ordered as well with $<$ restricted to that subset.
      \item If $A$ has the order relation $<_1$ and $B$ has the order relation $<_2$ and both are well-ordered, then $A \times B$ is well-ordered with the dictionary order.
      \item Given any countable set $A$, we know there exists a bijection $f$ from $A$ to $\mathbb{Z}_+$. Hence, given $a, b \in A$, we can say that $a < b \Longleftrightarrow f(a) < f(b)$. Then, $A$ is well-ordered by $<$ with the least element of any subset $S$ of $A$ being the element $\alpha \in A$ such that $f(\alpha)$ is the least element in $f(S)$.

   An important theorem (which I will hopefully prove soon) is:
   
   \begin{myIndent}
      \blab{The Well Ordering Theorem:} If $A$ is a set, there exists an order relation on $A$ that is well-ordering.
      
      \begin{myIndent}\myComment

   \exOne\blab{Exercise 10.5:} Show that the well-ordering theorem implies the (infinite) axiom of choice.
   \begin{myIndent}\exTwo
      Let $\mathcal{A}$ be a collection of disjoint sets. By the well-ordering theorem, we can pick an order relation on $\bigcup\limits_{A \in \mathcal{A}}\hspace{-0.4em}A$ that is well-ordering.\newpage
      
      \begin{myIndent}\myComment
         Note that the previous sentence is carefully worded to only make use of the finite axiom of choice. Specifically, the order relation we are picking is an element of some subset of $\bigcup\limits_{A \in \mathcal{A}}A \times \bigcup\limits_{A \in \mathcal{A}}A$.\retTwo

         If we had instead picked a well-ordering for each $A \in \mathcal{A}$, then that would require the axiom of choice as we would be making potentially infinitely many arbitrary choices of order relations.\retTwo

      Now let $C = \{a \in \hspace{-0.2em}\bigcup\limits_{A \in \mathcal{A}}\hspace{-0.2em}A \mid \exists A \in \mathcal{A} \suchthat a \in A \text{ and } \forall b \in A,\myHS a \leq b \}$.\retTwo Then $C$ fulfils the properties of the set that the axiom of choice would guarentee exists.\retTwo

      Let $U = \{a \in A \mid \forall b \in B, \myHS b \leq a\}$. Since $\alpha \in U$, we know that $U \neq \emptyset$. So, because $A$ is well-ordered, we know that $U$ has a least element $\beta$. This $\beta$ is by definition the least upper bound of $B$. So $\sup{B} = \beta$.\retTwo\retTwo

      Let $A$ be a countable subset of $S_\Omega$. For all $a \in A$, we know that $S_a$ is countable. Therefore, $B = \bigcup\limits_{a \in A}S_a$ is also countable, meaning that $S_\Omega - B \neq \emptyset$.\retTwo

      If we pick $x \in S_\Omega - B$, we must have that $x$ is an upper bound to $A$ because if $x < a$ for some $a \in A$, we would have that $x \in S_a \subseteq B$.\retTwo

      \begin{myIndent}\exTwo
         Let $A$ be a well-ordered set and let $\alpha$ be any element in $A$ such that there exists $\beta \in A$ for which $\alpha < \beta$. Then consider the set $S = \{x \in A \mid \alpha < x < \beta\}$. If $S = \emptyset$, then we know $\alpha$ has $\beta$ as its successor. Meanwhile, if $S \neq \emptyset$, then since $A$ is well-ordered, we know that $A$ has a least element $\gamma$. Thus, the set $\{x \in A \mid \alpha < x < \gamma\} = \emptyset$ and we know that $\gamma$ is the successor of $\alpha$.\retTwo

       \begin{myIndent}\exTwo
         Consider the set $\mathbb{Z}$ of all integers using the standard ordering. Then for any $n \in \mathbb{Z}$, we know that its successor is $n + 1$. At the same time though, the set of all negative integers has no least element. So $\mathbb{Z}$ is not well-ordered by $<$.\retTwo\retTwo

   \blab{Exercise 10.6:}
   \begin{itemize}
      \item[(c)] Let $X_0$ be the subset of $S_\Omega$ consisting of all elements $x$ such that $x$ has no\\ immediate predecessor. Show that $X_0$ is uncountable.
      
      \begin{myIndent}\exTwo
         Suppose $X_0$ is bounded above by some $\alpha \in S_\Omega$. Thus, there is a predecessor $x \in S_\Omega$ for any $y$ in the set $T = \{z \in S_\Omega \mid z > \alpha\}$.\newpage

         Now define a function $f: \mathbb{Z}_+ \longrightarrow T$ such that $f(1) =$ the least element of $T$ and $f(n) =$ the successor of $f(n - 1)$ for all $n > 1$. We know this function is well-defined because $S_\Omega$ has no largest element according to exercise 10.6.a. So, all elements of $S_\Omega$ and thus $T$ have a successor by exercises 10.2.a, meaning our formula for $f(n)$ is always defined no matter what $f(n-1)$ is. Hence, the principle of recursive definition guarentees a unique $f$ exists.\retTwo

         Now it's easy to show that $f$ is injective. For suppose that given some $x, n \in \mathbb{Z}_+$ we had that $f(x) = f(x + n)$. Then that would mean that:

         {\centering $f(x) < f(x + 1) < \cdots < f(x + n - 1) < f(x + n) = f(x) $\retTwo\par}

         Hence we have a contradiction as $f(x) < f(x)$.\retTwo

         Next, we show that $f$ is surjective. Suppose the set $R = T - f(\mathbb{Z}_+) \neq \emptyset$. Then since $S_\Omega$ and hence $T$ is well-ordered, we know that $R$ has a least element $\beta$. But note that $\beta$ has a predecessor $\gamma$ which isn't in $R$. More specifically, since we know that the least element of $T$ is in $f(\mathbb{Z}_+)$, we know that $\gamma$ is at least the least of element of $T$. So $\gamma \in T$.\retTwo

         Thus we conclude that $\gamma \in T - (T - f(\mathbb{Z}_+)) = f(\mathbb{Z}_+)$, meaning there exists $N$ such that $f(N) = \gamma$. But this means that $f(N + 1) = \beta$, which contradicts that $\beta$ is the least element of $R$.\retTwo

         With that, we've now shown that $f: \mathbb{Z}_+ \longrightarrow T$ is a bijection, meaning that $T$ is countable. However, this contradicts exercise 10.6.b. which asserts that $T$ is uncountable.\retTwo

         Therefore, we conclude that $X_0$ cannot be bounded above. And by theorem 10.3, that means that $X_0$ can't be a countable subset of $S_\Omega$.\retTwo

      \begin{myIndent}\exTwo
         ($\Longleftarrow$)\\
         If for some $B \subseteq A$, we have that $f: \mathbb{Z}_- \longrightarrow B$ is an order preserving bijection, then we must have that $B$ has no least element. Hence, not all subsets of $A$ have a least element, meaning that $A$ is not well-ordered.\retTwo

         ($\Longrightarrow$)\\
         If $A$ is not well ordered, then we know there is a set $B \subseteq A$ with no least element. Now using the axiom of choice, choose any $\beta_1 \in B$. Then for all\\ $n > 1$, choose $\beta_n \in B_{\beta_{n-1}}$. In other words, choose $\beta_n \in B$ such that\\ $\beta_n < \beta_{n-1}$.\newpage
         
         Finally, define $f: \mathbb{Z}_- \longrightarrow \{\beta_n \mid n \in \mathbb{Z}_+\}$ by the rule: $f(n) = \beta_{-n}$. This $f$ is an order preserving bijection. Thus, the set $\{\beta_n \mid n \in \mathbb{Z}_+\} \subseteq A$ has the same order type as $\mathbb{Z}_-$.\retTwo

Clearly, $B$ has no least element. Also, the function $g(n) = f(-n)$ gives a bijection from $\mathbb{Z}_+$ to $B$, meaning that $B$ is countable.

   \begin{myTindent}\hThree
      In other words, there exists a subset $B$ of $A$ such that $B$ is simply ordered by $\prec$ and no subset of $A$ that properly contains $B$ is simply ordered by $\prec$.\retTwo

   \begin{myIndent}\hTwo
      Proof:\\
      To start out, let $J$ be a set well-ordered by $<$ such that the elements of $A$\\ are indexed in a bijective fashion by the elements of $J$. In other words,\\ $A = \{a_\alpha \in A \mid \alpha \in J\}$.
      \begin{myIndent}\myComment
         Assuming the well-ordering theorem, we know that $J$ exists. Specifically let $J$ refer to the same set as $A$ but equip $J$ with the well-ordering $<$ that we know exists instead of the partial ordering $\prec$ which we equipped $A$.\retTwo
      \end{myIndent}

      Now our goal is to construct a function $h: J \longrightarrow \{0, 1\}$ such that $h(\alpha) = 1$ if $a_\alpha$\\ is in our maximal simply ordered subset of $A$ and $h(\alpha) = 0$ otherwise. To do this, we rely on the \textbf{general principle of recursive definition}.\retTwo

               Let $J$ be a well-ordered set and $C$ be any set. Given a\newline function $\rho: \mathcal{F} \longrightarrow C$ where $\mathcal{F}$ is the set of all functions\newline mapping sections of $J$ into $C$, we have that there exists a\newline unique functon $h: J \longrightarrow C$ satisfying that $h(\alpha) = \rho(h|_{S_\alpha})$\newline for all $\alpha \in J$.

      Given any $\alpha \in J$ and $f: S_\alpha \longrightarrow \{0, 1\}$, define $\rho(\alpha) = 1$ if $a_\alpha \in A$ is comparable to all $a_\beta \in A$ such that $\beta \in f^{-1}(1)$ (the preimage of $1$).

         Note that $a_\alpha$ is comparable to $a_\beta$ if either $a_\alpha \prec a_\beta$ or $a_\beta \prec a_\alpha$.\newpage
      \end{myTindent}

      Then by the general principle of recursive definition, we know a unique function $h: J \longrightarrow \{0, 1\}$ exists such that for all $\alpha \in J$, we have that $h(\alpha) = 1$ only when $a_\alpha$ is comparable to all $a_\beta \in A$ such that $\beta \in S_\alpha$ and $h(\beta) = 1$.\retTwo

      Let $B = \{a_\alpha \in A \mid \alpha \in J \text{ and } h(\alpha) = 1\}$. Then given any $a_\alpha, a_\beta \in B$ such that $\alpha < \beta$, we know that either $a_\alpha \prec a_\beta$ or $a_\beta \prec a_\alpha$. Hence, $B$ is simply ordered by $\prec$. At the same time, if $a_\gamma \notin B$, then we know $h(\gamma) = 0$, meaning there exists $a_\alpha \in B$ such that $\alpha < \gamma$ and  $a_\gamma$ is not comparable to $a_\alpha$. This shows that any set properly containing $B$ is not simply ordered by $\prec$.

      
      \begin{myIndent}\myComment
         Note that the maximal simply ordered subset $B$ is not unique. In fact, choosing a different well-ordering of $J$ is likely to give a completely different maximal simply ordered subset.\retTwo

   Let $A$ be a set and let $\prec$ be a strict partial order on $A$.

   \begin{myIndent}\hTwo
      Proof:\\
      By the Hausdorff maximum principle, there exists a maximal simply ordered subset $B$ of $A$. Let $c$ be an element of $A$ that is an upperbound to $B$. We claim that $c$ is a maximal element of $A$. For suppose there exists $d \in A$ such that $c \prec d$. We know $d \notin B$ since that would imply $d \prec c$. But by the transitivity of $\prec$, we know that $b \preceq c \prec d \Longrightarrow b \prec d$ for all $b \in B$. Hence, $B \cup \{d\}$ is simply ordered by $\prec$. This contradicts that $B$ is a maximal simply ordered subset of $A$.\retTwo\retTwo

   \begin{itemize}\exTwo
      \item It's easy to show that $\prec$ is a strict partial order. After all, for all $a \in \mathbb{R}$, we have that $a - a$ is not positive. Also, if $a \prec b$ and $b \prec c$, then we know that $b - a = p$ and $c - b = q$ where $p, q \in \mathbb{Q}_+$. But then $c - a = c - b + b - a = p + q \in \mathbb{Q}_+$. So $a \prec c$.\retTwo

   \pracOne\mySepTwo

   \blab{Tangent:} I never got around to writing this down last quarter. So here's a proof that\\ assuming the axiom of choice, non-Lebesgue measurable sets exist.
   
   \begin{myIndent}\pracTwo
      Let $\mathcal{B}$ be the collection of sets of the form $S_x = [0, 1] \cap \{x + p \mid p \in \mathbb{Q}\}$ where $x$ is any real number. Obviously, all the sets in $\mathcal{B}$ are nonempty. We also claim that all the sets in $\mathcal{B}$ are disjoint. For suppose $S_x, S_y \in \mathcal{B}$ and $S_x \cap S_y \neq \emptyset$. Then fix $c \in S_x \cap S_y$ and consider any $a \in S_x$ and $b \in S_y$.\retTwo

      We know $c - x = p_1$, $a - x = p_2$, $c - y = q_1$, and $b - y = q_2$ where $p_1, p_2, q_1, q_2 \in \mathbb{Q}$. Thus, we have that $a - y = (a - x) + (x - c) + (c - y) = p_2 - p_1 + q_1 \in \mathbb{Q}$. Similarly, we have that $b - x = (b - y) + (y - c) + (c - x) = q_2 - q_1 + p_1 \in \mathbb{Q}$. This tells us that $a \in S_y$ and $b \in S_x$. And since this works for all $a \in S_x$ and $b \in S_y$, we thus must have that $S_x = S_y$.\retTwo

      Now using the axiom of choice, let $V$ be a set containing one element from each set in $\mathcal{B}$.\retTwo

      To show that $V$ is nonmeasurable, we'll reach a contradiction by supposing $V$ is\\ measurable. Let $q_1, q_2, \ldots$ be an enumeration of all the rational numbers in the set $[-1, 1]$. Then having defined $V + q_n = \{v + q_n \mid v \in V\}$, consider the set: $\hspace{-0.3em}\bigcup\limits_{n \in \mathbb{Z}_+}\hspace{-0.3em}(V + q_n)$.\\

      Obviously, since $V \subseteq [0,1]$, we know that $\hspace{-0.3em}\bigcup\limits_{n \in \mathbb{Z}_+}\hspace{-0.3em}(V + q_n) \subseteq [-1, 2]$.\\

      Also, consider any $x \in [0, 1]$ and let $v$ be the element of $V$ which was chosen from the set $S_x \in \mathcal{B}$. Then $v - x = p$ where $p$ is some rational number in $[-1, 1]$. So, we also know that $[0, 1] \subseteq \hspace{-0.3em}\bigcup\limits_{n \in \mathbb{Z}_+}\hspace{-0.3em}(V + q_n)$. This means that $1 \leq \mu(\hspace{-0.3em}\bigcup\limits_{n \in \mathbb{Z}_+}\hspace{-0.3em}(V + q_n)) \leq 3$.\\

      But now note that for any $n, m \in \mathbb{Z}_+$, we have that $n \neq m \Longrightarrow V + q_n \cap V + q_m = \emptyset$. To prove this, assume $V + q_n \cap V + q_m \neq \emptyset$. Thus, there would exist $v, u \in V$ such that $v + q_n = u + q_m$. In turn, we'd have that $v - u = q_m - q_n \in \mathbb{Q}$, which means that\\ $v \in S_u$. However, this contradicts that $V$ has only one element of $S_u$.\\ [-4pt]

      Now since $\mu$ is countably additive, we have that $\mu(\hspace{-0.3em}\bigcup\limits_{n \in \mathbb{Z}_+}\hspace{-0.3em}(V + q_n)) = \sum\limits_{n = 1}^\infty \mu(V + q_n)$.\\
      
      Finally, note that $\mu(V) = \mu(V + q_n)$ for all $n$. Thus $\sum\limits_{n = 1}^\infty \mu(V + q_n) = \sum\limits_{n = 1}^\infty \mu(V)$ is either\\ [-6pt] $0$ or $\infty$.\retTwo
      
      But this contradicts our earlier finding that the measure was between $1$ and $3$. So, we conclude that $V \notin \mathfrak{M}(\mu)$. $\blacksquare$

   \begin{myIndent}
      \blab{Kuratowski's Lemma:} Let $\mathcal{A}$ be a collection of sets. Suppose that for every subcollection $\mathcal{B}$ of $\mathcal{A}$ that is simply ordered by proper inclusion, the union of the elements of $\mathcal{B}$ belongs to $\mathcal{A}$. Then $\mathcal{A}$ has an element that is properly contained in no other element of $\mathcal{A}$.\retTwo
      
      \begin{myIndent}\exTwo\color{RedViolet}
         To be clear, given any $A, B \in \mathcal{A}$, we defined above that $A \prec B$ if $A \subset B$. Importantly, our assumption about $\mathcal{A}$ means that every subcollection $\mathcal{B}$ of $\mathcal{A}$ that is simply ordered by $\prec$ has an upper bound in $\mathcal{A}$: $\bigcup\limits_{B \in \mathcal{B}}\hspace{-0.2em}B$.\retTwo
         
         Thus by Zorn's lemma, we know that $\mathcal{A}$ has a maximal element $C$. And since there is no element $D \in \mathcal{A}$ such that $C \prec D$, we know that $C$ is properly contained by no sets in $\mathcal{A}$.\retTwo

   \end{myIndent}

   \blab{Exercise 11.6:} A collection $\mathcal{A}$ of subsets of a set $X$ is said to be of \textit{finite type}\\ provided that a subset $B$ of $X$ belongs to $\mathcal{A}$ if and only if every finite subset\\ of $B$ belongs to $\mathcal{A}$. Show that the Kuratowski lemma implies the following:

   
   \begin{myIndent}
      \blab{Tukey's Lemma:} Let $\mathcal{A}$ be a collection of sets. If $\mathcal{A}$ is of finite type, then $\mathcal{A}$ has an element that is properly contained in no other element of $\mathcal{A}$.\newpage
      
      \begin{myIndent}\exTwo\color{RedViolet}
         To start off I want to clarify that $\mathcal{A}$ being of finite types means both that:
         \begin{enumerate}
            \item[1.] For each $A \in \mathcal{A}$, every finite subset of $A$ belongs to $\mathcal{A}$.
            \item[2.] If every finite subset of a given set $A$ belongs to $\mathcal{A}$, then $A$ belongs to $\mathcal{A}$.\\
         \end{enumerate}

         Now let $\mathcal{B}$ be any subcollection of $\mathcal{A}$ that is simply ordered by proper\\ inclusion. Next, consider the set $S = \bigcup\limits_{B \in \mathcal{B}}B$. We want to show that any\\ [-8pt] finite subset of $S$ is in $\mathcal{A}$.\retTwo

         To do this, let $n \in \mathbb{Z}_+$ and consider any subset $\{b_1, b_2, \ldots, b_n\}$ of $S$ with $n$ elements. Note that for each $1 \leq i \leq n$, there exists $B_i \in \mathcal{B}$ such that $b_i \in B_i$. Then since $\{B_1, B_2, \ldots B_n\}$ is a simply ordered finite set, we know that it has a maximum element $B_m$ such that $B_i \subseteq B_m$ for all $i$. Hence, we have that $\{b_1, b_2, \ldots b_n\}$ is contained by some $B_m$ in $\{B_1, B_2, \ldots, B_n\} \subseteq \mathcal{B}$. Because $\mathcal{A}$ is of finite type, this tells us that $\{b_1, b_2, \ldots b_n\} \in \mathcal{A}$.\retTwo

         Since we showed above that any finite subset of $S$ is in $\mathcal{A}$, we can thus conclude because $\mathcal{A}$ is of finite type that $S \in \mathcal{A}$. And so, we have now proven the hypothesis of Kuratowski's lemma, meaning that $\mathcal{A}$ must have a set that is properly contained in other element of $\mathcal{A}$.\retTwo

      Let $A$ be a set with the strict partial order $\prec$. Then let $\mathcal{A}$ be the collection of all subsets of $A$ that are simply ordered by $\prec$. We shall show below that $\mathcal{A}$ is of finite type.
      
      \begin{enumerate}
         \item Suppose $B \in \mathcal{A}$. Then given any subset $C$ of $B$ (finite or not), we know that $C$ is also simply ordered by $\prec$. So $C \in \mathcal{A}$.
         \item Let $B \subseteq A$ and suppose every finite subset of $B$ is in $\mathcal{A}$. Then given any two different elements $b_1, b_2 \in B$, we know that $\{b_1, b_2\} \in \mathcal{A}$, meaning that either $b_1 \prec b_2$ or $b_2 \prec b_1$. In other words, $B$ is simply ordered by $\prec$, meaning that $B \in \mathcal{A}$.\retTwo

      Because $\mathcal{A}$ is of finite type, we know that $\mathcal{A}$ has an element that is properly\\ contained in no other element of $\mathcal{A}$.

   We already addressed this before. I'm skipping proving this because the proof is mostly identical to exercise 10.10. In fact, exercise 10.10 is just this exercise but with a specific $\rho: \mathcal{F} \longrightarrow C$.\retTwo

\blab{Exercise 2:} 
\begin{itemize}
   \item[(a)] Let $J$ and $E$ be well-ordered sets and let $h: J \longrightarrow E$. Show that the following two statement are equivalent:
   \begin{enumerate}
      \item[(i)] $h$ is order preserving and its image is $E$ or a section of $E$.
      \item[(ii)] $h(\alpha) = \text{smallest}(E - h(S_\alpha))$ for all $\alpha \in J$. 
      
      \begin{myIndent}\exTwo\color{RedViolet}
         (i) $\Longrightarrow$ (ii):\\
         Given any $\alpha \in J$, we know that $h(\alpha)$ must be an upper bound to $h(S_\alpha)$. Now suppose $\exists \beta \in S_{h(\alpha)}$ such that $\beta \notin h(S_\alpha)$. Because of our assumption about the image of $h$, we know that $\beta \in h(J)$, meaning there exists $\gamma \in J$ such that $h(\gamma) = \beta$. But because $h$ is order-preserving, we must have that $\beta < f(\alpha) \Longrightarrow \gamma < \alpha$. This contradicts that $\beta \notin h(S_\alpha)$.\retTwo

         With that, we've now shown that $h(S_\alpha) = S_{h(\alpha)}$. In turn, this shows that $h(\alpha)$ is the smallest element in $E - h(S_\alpha)$.\retTwo

         (ii) $\Longrightarrow$ (i):\\
         It's easy to show $h$ is order preserving. Let $\alpha, \beta \in J$ such that $\alpha < \beta$.\\ Then $h(S_\alpha) \subset h(S_\beta)$, meaning that $E - h(S_\beta) \subset E - h(S_\alpha)$. And\\ since the least element of $E - h(S_\alpha)$ is not in $E - h(S_\beta)$, that means that\\ $h(\alpha) = \text{smallest}(E - h(S_\alpha)) < \text{smallest}(E - h(S_\beta)) = h(\beta)$.\newpage

         As for showing the other property of $h$, let $J_0 = \{\alpha \in J \mid h(S_\alpha) = S_{h(\alpha)}\}$. Now suppose that for some $\alpha \in J$, we have that $S_\alpha \subseteq J_0$. Then we can show that $\alpha \in J_0$.
         
         \begin{myIndent}\exPP
            Case 1: $\alpha$ has an immediate predecessor $\beta$.
            
            \begin{myIndent}
               Then $S_\alpha = S_\beta \cup \{\beta\}$, meaning that:
   
               {\centering $h(S_\alpha) = h(S_\beta) \cup \{h(\beta)\} = S_{h(\beta)} \cup \{h(\beta)\}$.\retTwo\par}
               
               Since $h(\alpha)$ is the least element of $E$ not in $h(S_\alpha)$. We can thus say that $S_{h(\beta)} \cup \{h(\beta)\} = S_{h(\alpha)}$.\retTwo
            \end{myIndent}

            Case 2: $\alpha$ has no immediate predecessor.

            \begin{myIndent}
               Then we have that $h(S_\alpha) = h(\hspace{-0.2em}\bigcup\limits_{\beta \in S_\alpha}\hspace{-0.4em}S_\beta) = \hspace{-0.2em}\bigcup\limits_{\beta \in S_\alpha}\hspace{-0.4em}h(S_\beta) = \hspace{-0.2em}\bigcup\limits_{\beta \in S_\alpha}\hspace{-0.4em}S_{h(\beta)}$.\retTwo

               Hence, $h(S_\alpha)$ is a section of $E$, and since $h(\alpha)$ is the least element not in that section, we can conclude that $h(S_\alpha) = S_{h(\alpha)}$.\retTwo
            \end{myIndent}
         \end{myIndent}

         By transfinite induction, we thus know that $J_0 = J$. So finally, we consider two cases.\retTwo

         \begin{myIndent}\exPP
            Case 1: $J$ has a max element $\alpha$.
            
            \begin{myIndent}
               Then $h(J) = h(S_\alpha) \cup \{h(\alpha)\} = S_{h(\alpha)} \cup \{h(\alpha)\}$. And since $h(\alpha)$ is the least element not in $S_{h(\alpha)}$, we thus know that $h(J)$ is either a section of or the whole of $E$.
            \end{myIndent}

            Case 2: $J$ has no max element.

            \begin{myIndent}
               Then $h(J) = h(\hspace{-0.1em}\bigcup\limits_{\alpha \in J}\hspace{-0.3em}S_\alpha) = \hspace{-0.1em}\bigcup\limits_{\alpha \in J}\hspace{-0.3em}h(S_\alpha) = \hspace{-0.1em}\bigcup\limits_{\alpha \in J}\hspace{-0.3em}S_{h(\alpha)}$.\retTwo
               
               So, $h(J)$ is either a section of or the whole of $E$.\retTwo
            \end{myIndent}
         \end{myIndent}
      \end{myIndent}
   \end{enumerate}

   \item[(b)] If $E$ is a well-ordered set, show that no section of $E$ has the same order type as $E$, nor do any two different sections of $E$ have the same order type.
   
   
   \begin{myIndent}\exTwo\color{RedViolet}
      Let $J$ be any well-ordered set. By combining part (a) of this exercise with\\ exercise 10.10 (which is a special case of the general principle of recursive\\ definition), we know that there is at most one order preserving map from $J$\\ to $E$ whose image is either $E$ or a section of $E$. Hence, $J$ can only have the\\ same order type as one of either the entirety of $E$ or one section of $E$.\retTwo

      Based on that fact, we can get an easy contradiction if we assume that the claim of part (b) is false.\newpage

Unfortunately I tested positive for Covid on the two days ago. So I've been really delirious. However, right now I'm in an airport in the process of moving back out to California (great idea). And since my flight just got delayed, I feel like I might as well kill time and try to do some math.\retTwo

\exOne\blab{Exercise 3:} Let $J$ and $E$ be well-ordered sets, and suppose there is an order-preserving map $k: J \longrightarrow E$. Using exercises 1 and 2, show that $J$ has the order type of one of either $E$ or one section of $E$.\retTwo


\begin{myIndent}\exTwoP
   Pick any $e_0 \in E$. Then define $h: J \longrightarrow E$ by the rule: 
   
   {\centering$h(\alpha) = \left\{
   \begin{matrix}
      \text{smallest}(E - h(S_\alpha)) & \text{ if } h(S_\alpha) \neq E \\
      e_0 & \text{ otherwise }
   \end{matrix}\right.$\retTwo\par} 

   Note that the second case of our definition of $h$ is just included to ensure that $h$ is well-defined before we begin the proof in earnest. I mention that because our goal now is to show that the second case will never apply.\retTwo

   Let $J_0 = \{\alpha \in J \mid h(\alpha)\leq k(\alpha)\}$. Then suppose that for some $\alpha \in J$, we have that $S_\alpha \subseteq J_0$. Because $k$ is order preserving, we know that $k(\alpha) > k(\beta) \geq h(\beta)$ for all $\beta \in S_\alpha$. Hence, $k(\alpha) \notin h(S_\alpha)$, meaning that $h(S_\alpha) \neq E$. So, we conclude that $h(\alpha) = \text{smallest}(E - h(S_\alpha))$. And since $k(\alpha) \in E - h(S_\alpha)$, we thus know that $h(\alpha) \leq k(\alpha)$\retTwo
   
   Therefore, $\alpha \in J_0$. By transfinite induction, this proves that $J = J_0$. The reason this is relavent is that we can now say that $k(\alpha)$ is never in $h(S_\alpha)$ , meaning that $E - h(S_\alpha) \neq \emptyset$. So $h(\alpha)$, will never be determined by the second case of our definition above.\retTwo

   By exercise 2, we know that $h: J \longrightarrow E$ is the unique order-preserving map whose image is either $E$ or a section of $E$. Thus, $J$ has the same order type as exactly one of either the entirety of $E$ or one section of $E$.\retTwo
\end{myIndent}

\blab{Exercise 4:} Use exercises 1-3 to prove the following:

\begin{itemize}
   \item[(a)] If $A$ and $B$ are well-ordered sets, then exactly one of the following three\\ conditions holds: $A$ and $B$ have the same order type, $A$ has the order type of\\ a section of $B$, or $B$ has the order type of a section of $A$.
   
   
   \begin{myIndent}\exTwoP
      To start off, it's relatively easy to show that at most one of the above three cases is true. After all, $A$ having the same order type as $B$ as well as a section of $B$ contradicts exercise 2. Similarly $B$ having the same order type as $A$ as well as a section of $A$ contradicts exercise 2.\newpage

      Meanwhile, to find a contradiction if $A$ has the order type of $S_\beta$ and $B$ has the order type of $S_\alpha$ where $\alpha \in A$ and $\beta \in B$, let $h: A \longrightarrow S_\alpha$ be the function defined by the rule $h(a) = g(f(a))$ where $f$ is the order-preserving bijection from $A$ to $S_\beta$ and $g$ is the order-preserving bijection from $B$ to $S_\alpha$.\retTwo

      Then given any $a, b \in A$, we know that:
      
      {\centering $a < b \Rightarrow f(a) < f(b) \Rightarrow h(a) = g(f(a)) < g(f(b)) = h(b)$.\retTwo\par}

      Hence, $h$ is an order preserving map from $A$ to $S_\alpha$. This gives us a contradiction since exercise 3 would then imply that $A$ has the same order type as either $S_\alpha$ or a section of $S_\alpha$ (which would still be a section of $A$).\retTwo

      Now, what's left to show is that at least one of the three above cases must be true. Unfortunately, the hinted route for showing this uses an exercise I didn't do. And right now I really don't want to do that exercise. So I'm just going to write out the thing I was supposed to have proven earlier.\retTwo

         \begin{myIndent}
            Let $A_1$ and $A_2$ be disjoint sets well-ordered by $<_1$ and\newline $<_2$ respectively. Then define an order relation on $A_1 \cup A_2$\newline by letting $a < b$ either if $a, b \in A_1$ and $a <_1 b$, or if\newline $a, b \in A_2$ and $a <_2 b$, or if $a \in A_1$ and $b \in A_2$. This is a\newline well-ordering of $A_1 \cup A_2$.

      Let $A^\prime = \{A\} \times A$ and let $B^\prime = \{B\} \times B$. That way, so long as $A \neq B$, we know that $A^\prime$ and $B^\prime$ are disjoint. (The case where $A = B$ is trivial.)\retTwo
      
      It's hopefully obvious that the well-orderings of $A$ and $B$ can be used to well-\\order $A^\prime$ and $B^\prime$. For $A^\prime$, define $(A, a_1) <_{A^\prime} (A, a_2)$ if $a_1 <_A a_2$. Similarly, define the analogous ordering for $B^\prime$. Clearly, $A$ and $A^\prime$ have the same order type, as do $B$ and $B^\prime$. Also, given any $\alpha \in A$ and $\beta \in B$,\myHS $S_\alpha$ and $S_{(A, \alpha)}$ have the same order type, as do $S_\beta$ and $S_{(B, \beta)}$\retTwo

      Next, define a well-ordering on $A^\prime \cup B^\prime$ by letting $a^\prime < b^\prime$ if either $a^\prime, b^\prime \in A^\prime$ and $a^\prime <_{A^\prime} b^\prime$, or if $a^\prime, b^\prime \in B^\prime$ and $a^\prime <_{B^\prime} b^\prime$, or if $a^\prime \in A^\prime$ and $b^\prime \in B^\prime$.\retTwo

      Note that the inclusion function from $B^\prime$ to $A^\prime \cup B^\prime$ is an order-preserving\\ map. Thus, by exercise 3, we know that $B^\prime$ has the order type of one of either $A^\prime \cup B^\prime$ or one section of $A^\prime \cup B^\prime$.

      \begin{myIndent}
         Case 1: $B^\prime$ has the order type of a section $S_\alpha$ of $A^\prime \cup B^\prime$.

            If $\alpha$ is the first element of $B$, then $B^\prime$ has the same order type as $A^\prime$, meaning $B$ has the same order type as $A$.\retTwo

            If $\alpha \in B^\prime$, then there exists an order preserving bijection from $B^\prime$ to $A^\prime \cup \{b \in B^\prime \mid b <_{B^\prime} \alpha\}$. So let $f$ be the inverse of that bijection but with it's domain restricted to just $A^\prime$. Since $f$ is also an order-preserving map, we know by exercise 3 that $A^\prime$ has the order type of either $B^\prime$ or a section of $B^\prime$. This would mean that $A$ has the order type of either $B$ or a section of $B$.\retTwo

This would mean that $A$ has the order type of either $B$ or a section of $B$.\retTwo

      \exTwoP
      To start, let's quickly double check that $<^\prime$ is a valid order relation on $B^\prime$.
      \begin{itemize}
         \item[(i)] Given any $b \in B^\prime$, if $b \in B$ for any $(B, <) \in \mathcal{B}$, then we know that\\ $(b, b) \notin {<}$. So $(b, b) \notin {<^\prime}$.\\ [-9pt]

         \item[(iii)] Given $a, b, c \in B^\prime$, suppose $a <^\prime b <^\prime c$. Then there exists $(B_1, <_1)$ and\\ $(B_2, <_2)$ in $\mathcal{B}$ such that $(a, b) \in {<_1}$ and $(b, c) \in {<_2}$. Now by how we defined $\mathcal{B}$, we know that either ${<_1} \subset {<_2}$ or ${<_2} \subset {<_1}$. Thus, we know $(a, b), (b, c) \in \{<_i\}$ for some $i \in \{1, 2\}$. Hence, $(a, c) \in {<_i}$, meaning that $(a, c) \in {<^\prime}$.\retTwo
      \end{itemize}

      Next, we show that $B^\prime$ is well-ordered by $<^\prime$.\retTwo
      
      Let $S \subseteq B^\prime$ be nonempty and pick any element $\beta$ in $S$. Then we know there exists $(B_1, <_1) \in \mathcal{B}$ such that $\beta \in B_1$. Also, $B_1$ is well-ordered by $<$. So let $\alpha$ be the least element (using $<_1$) of $B_1 \cap S$.\retTwo

      We claim that $\alpha$ is the least element (using $<^\prime$) of $S$. To prove this, suppose there exists $c \in S$ such that $c <^\prime a$. Then we know $(c, \alpha) \in {<_2}$ for some\\ $(B_2, <_2) \in \mathcal{B}$. Importantly, $(B_1, <_1) \neq (B_2, <_2)$ since otherwise we'd have chosen $\alpha$ differently. So one must be a section of the other.
      
      \begin{itemize}
         \item[\bullet] If $(B_2, <_2)$ is a section of $(B_1, <_1)$, then we know that ${<_2} \subset {<_1}$ and\\ $c \in B_1 \cap S$. But this contradicts how we chose $\alpha$.\\ [-9pt]

If $c <_2 \gamma$, then we know that $c \in B_1$ and thus $B_1 \cap S$. This contradicts how we chose $\alpha$. So we must have that $\gamma <_2 c$. But then this also gives us a contradiction as $\alpha <_2 \gamma <_2 c \Longrightarrow \alpha <_2 c$, meaning that $\alpha <^\prime c$.\retTwo

   \end{myIndent}

   \item[(c)] [Not in the book...] Given any $\mathcal{B}$ from part (b) of this problem and defining\\ $(B^\prime, <^\prime)$ as before, we have that $(B, <) \preceq (B^\prime, <^\prime)$ for all $(B, <) \in \mathcal{B}$.
   \begin{myIndent}
      \exTwoP
      Consider any $(B_1, <_1) \in \mathcal{B}$. If $B_1 \neq B^\prime$, then we know there exists $\alpha \in B^\prime - B_1$, thus meaning there exists $(B_2, <_2) \in \mathcal{B}$ such that $\alpha \in B_2$. Since $B_2 \not\prec B_1$, we know that $B_1 \prec B_2$, meaning that $B_1 = S_\beta \subseteq B_2$ for some $\beta \in B_2$.\newpage

      Now we know that $\{b \in B^\prime \mid b <^\prime \beta\} \subseteq \{b \in B_2 \mid b <_2 \beta\}$. For suppose\\ there exists $a$ in the former set but not the latter set. Then there must exist\\ $(B_3, <_3)  \in \mathcal{B}$ such that $(a, b) \in {<_3}$.\retTwo

      If $a \in B_2$, then we'd have that $(b, a) \in <_2$. But that would imply that $(a, b)$ and $(b, a)$ are in $<^\prime$ which we know isn't possible. So we know that $B_3 \not\subseteq B_2$.\retTwo

      Since $\mathcal{B}$ is simply ordered by $\prec$ and we can't have that $B_3 \prec B_2$, we know that $B_2 \prec B_3$. So $B_2 = S_\gamma$ where $\gamma \in S_3$. Now $a <_3 \gamma$ would contradict that\\ $a \notin B_2$. So we must have that $\gamma <_3 a$. However, we also must have that\\ $b <_3 \gamma$, which contradicts that $a <_3 b$.\retTwo

      Hence, we've shown that $(B_1, <_1) \neq (B^\prime, <^\prime)$ implies that $(B_1, <_1) \prec (B^\prime, <^\prime)$.\retTwo

   Next, construct $B^\prime$ and $<^\prime$ as in exercise 5.b. We claim that $B^\prime = X$. To see this, suppose there exists $c \in X - B^\prime$. Then $B^\prime \cup \{c\}$ is well-ordered by the order\\ relation: ${<^\prime}\cup\{(b, c) \mid b \in B^\prime\}$. Hence $(B^\prime \cup \{c\}, {<^\prime}\cup\{(b, c) \mid b \in B^\prime\}) \in \mathcal{A}$.\retTwo

   At the same time, note that $(B^\prime, <^\prime) \prec (B^\prime \cup \{c\}, {<^\prime}\cup\{(b, c) \mid b \in B^\prime\})$. And since we have that $(B, <) \preceq (B^\prime, <^\prime)$ for all $(B, <) \in \mathcal{B}$, we thus know that for any $(B, <) \in \mathcal{B}$:

   This tells us both that $(B^\prime \cup \{c\}, {<^\prime}\cup\{(b, c) \mid b \in B^\prime\}) \notin \mathcal{B}$ and that\\ $(B^\prime \cup \{c\}, {<^\prime}\cup\{(b, c) \mid b \in B^\prime\})$ is comparable with all elements of $\mathcal{B}$. But\\ that contradicts that $\mathcal{B}$ is a maximal simply ordered subset of $\mathcal{A}$.\retTwo

\blab{Exercise 7:} Use exercises 1-5 to prove that the choice axiom implies the well-ordering theorem.\retTwo

Let $X$ be a set and $c$ be a fixed choice function for the nonempty subsets of $X$. If $T$ is a subset of $X$ and $<$ is a relation on $T$, we say that $(T, <)$ is a \udefine{tower} in $X$ if $<$ is a well-ordering of $T$ and if for each $x \in T$, $x = c(X - S_x(T))$ where $S_x(T)$ is the section of $T$ by $x$.

   \begin{myIndent}\exTwoP
      By applying exercise 4 and switching indices if necessary, we know that $T_1$ has the order type of one of either $T_2$ or one section of $T_2$. In other words, there exists an order preserving map $h: T_1 \longrightarrow T_2$ such that $h(T_1)$ equals $T_2$ or a section of $T_2$.\retTwo

      Now we assert that given any $x \in T_1$,\myHS $h(x) = x$. To prove this, first note\\ that because of transfinite induction, we can assume that $h(x) = x$ for all $x$ in $S_x(T_1)$. This means that we can assume $h(S_x(T_1)) = S_x(T_1)$. Also, as part of doing exercise 2, we proved that $h$ must satisfy that $h(S_x(T_1)) = S_{h(x)}(T_2)$.\\ Hence, $S_x(T_1) = S_{h(x)}(T_2)$. This let's us conclude that:

      {\centering $x = c(X - S_x(T_1)) = c(X - S_{h(x)}(T_2)) = h(x)$.\retTwo\par}

      With that we now know that $h(T_1) = T_1$. So $T_1$ equals either $T_2$ or a section of $T_2$.\retTwo

      Since $T \neq X$, let $y = c(X - T)$. Then define $T^\prime = T \cup \{y\}$ and\\ ${<^\prime} = {<} \cup \{(x, y) \mid x \in T\}$. Clearly, $(T^\prime, <^\prime)$ is a tower which contains\\ $(T, <)$ as a section.\retTwo

      
      \begin{myIndent}\exPP
         Clearly $T^\prime$ is well-ordered by $<^\prime$.\retTwo

   \item[(c)] Let $\{(T_k, <_k) \mid k \in K\}$ be the collection of all towers in $X$. Then define:

   Show that $(T, <)$ is a tower in $X$. Conclude that $T = X$.

   \begin{myIndent}\exTwoP
      If we define $\mathcal{A}$ and $\prec$ from $X$ as we did in exercise 5, we can see from part (a) of this problem that $\{(T_k, <_k) \mid k \in K\}$ is a subset of $\mathcal{A}$ that is simply ordered by $\prec$. Thus, from part (b) of exercise 5, we know that $T$ is well-ordered by $<$.\retTwo

      To prove that $T$ is a tower, consider any $y \in T$. Then we know there exists $k \in K$ such that $y \in T_k$. Furthermore, we know that $y = c(X - S_y(T_k))$. By, part (c) of exercise 5, we know that $T_k$ is either a section of $T$ or all of $T$. Hence, $S_y(T) = S_y(T_k)$. And thus we have that $y = c(X - S_y(T))$.\retTwo

      Now that we have shown $(T, <)$ is a tower in $X$, we get an easy contradiction if $T \neq X$. This is because $T$ must contain all towers, but $T$ not equalling $X$ would imply the existence of a tower not contained by $T$ due to part (b) of this exercise.\retTwo

      And since $T = X$, we thus have that $<$ is a well-ordering of $X$. $\blacksquare$\retTwo

I'm gonna skip doing exercise 8 of the supplementary exercise. Basically it shows that you can construct a well-ordered set with higher cardinality than an arbitrary well-ordered set, all without using the axiom of choice. Also, while that does mean we can construct a minimal uncountable well-ordered set without using the axiom of choice, theorem 10.3 requires the axiom of choice to prove. So almost nothing we discovered about a minimal uncountable well-ordered set can be proven without the axiom of choice.\retTwo

A \udefine{Topology} on a set $X$ is a collection $\mathcal{T}$ of subsets of $X$ having the properties:
\begin{enumerate}
   \item $\emptyset$ and $X$ are in $\mathcal{T}$.
   \item The union of the elements of any subcollection of $\mathcal{T}$ is in $\mathcal{T}$.
   \item The intersection of the elements of any finite subcollection of $\mathcal{T}$ is in $\mathcal{T}$.\newpage
\end{enumerate}

Technically, a topological space is an ordered pair $(X, \mathcal{T})$ consisting of a set $X$ and a topology $\mathcal{T}$ on $X$. But when no confusion will arise, we usually omit mentioning $\mathcal{T}$ and just call $X$ a topological space.\retTwo

Given a topological space $(X, \mathcal{T})$, we say that a subset $U$ of $X$ is an \udefine{open set} if $U \in \mathcal{T}$.\retTwo

Suppose $\mathcal{T}$ and $\mathcal{T}^\prime$ are topologies on $X$ Such that $\mathcal{T} \subseteq \mathcal{T}^\prime$. Then we say $\mathcal{T}^\prime$ is \udefine{finer} or \udefine{larger} than $\mathcal{T}$ Also, we say $\mathcal{T}$ is \udefine{coarser} or \udefine{smaller} than $\mathcal{T}^\prime$. And we say both are \udefine{comparable} with each other.

\begin{myIndent}\hThree
   If $\mathcal{T}$ is properly contained by $\mathcal{T}^\prime$, then we add the word \textit{strictly} before those adjectives.\retTwo

If $X$ is a set, a \udefine{basis} for a topology on $X$ is a collection $\mathcal{B}$ of subsets of $X$ (called \udefine{basis elements}) such that:
\begin{enumerate}
   \item For each $x \in X$, there is at least one basis element $B$ containing $x$.
   \item If $x$ belongs to the intersection of two basis elements $B_1$ and $B_2$, then there is a basis element $B_3$ containing $x$ such that $B_3 \subseteq B_1 \cap B_2$.\retTwo
\end{enumerate}

If $\mathcal{B}$ satisfies these two conditions, then we define the \udefine{topology $\mathcal{T}$ generated by $\mathcal{B}$} as follows:
\begin{myIndent}
   $U \subseteq X$ is open if for each $x \in U$, there is a basis element $B \in \mathcal{B}$ such that $x \in B$ and $B \subseteq U$.\retTwo
\end{myIndent}

\blab{Proof that the $\mathcal{T}$ generated by $\mathcal{B}$ is a topology:}
\begin{myIndent}\hTwo
   We fairly trivially have that $\emptyset$ and $X$ are included in $\mathcal{T}$.\retTwo

   Let $\{U_\alpha\}_{\alpha \in J}$ be an indexed family of elements of $\mathcal{T}$ and define $U = \bigcup\limits_{\alpha \in J}U_\alpha$.\\ [-8pt] Given any $x \in U$, we know there exists $\alpha \in J$ such that $x \in U_\alpha$.\\ And since $U_\alpha$ is open, there exists $B \in \mathcal{B}$ such that $x \in B$ and\\ $B \subseteq U_\alpha \subseteq U$. So, we conclude that $U$ is also open.\retTwo

   Finally, we shall prove by induction that given $U_1, \ldots U_n \in \mathcal{T}$, we have that\\ $U_1 \cap \ldots \cap U_n \in \mathcal{T}$.

   
   \begin{myIndent}\hThree
      Firstly, consider any $U_1, U_2 \in \mathcal{T}$. Then, given any $x \in U_1 \cap U_2$, choose\\ basis elements $B_1, B_2 \in \mathcal{B}$ such that $x \in B_1 \subseteq U_1$ and $x \in B_2 \subseteq U_2$. \\Since $x \in B_1 \cap B_2$, we know there is a basis element $B_3 \in \mathcal{B}$ such that\\ $x \in B_3 \subseteq B_1 \cap B_2$. Then $x \in B_3 \subseteq U$.\retTwo

      With that, we've now shown that the intersection of any two elements of $\mathcal{T}$\\ is also in $\mathcal{T}$. So, we can proceed by induction.\retTwo

      Suppose for $i < n$ that $(U_1 \cap \ldots \cap U_i) \in \mathcal{T}$. Then we know that\\ $(U_1 \cap \ldots \cap U_i) \cap U_{i+1} \in \mathcal{T}$.\newpage

\blab{Lemma 13.2}: Let $X$ be a topological space. Suppose that $\mathcal{C}$ is a collection of open sets of $X$ such that for each open set $U$ of $X$ and each $x \in U$, there is an element $C \in \mathcal{C}$ such that $x \in C \subseteq U$. Then $\mathcal{C}$ is a basis for the topology of $X$.

\begin{myIndent}\hTwo
   Proof:\\
   Firstly, we need to show that $\mathcal{C}$ is a basis.
   \begin{myIndent}\hThree
      Since $X$ is an open set, we know by hypothesis that for all $x \in X$, there is $C \in \mathcal{C}$ such that $x \in C$. As for the second condition of a basis, suppose $x \in C_1 \cap C_2$\\ where $C_1, C_2 \in \mathcal{C}$. Since $C_1$ and $C_2$ are open, we know that $C_1 \cap C_2$ is open. So\\ by hypothesis, there is $C_3 \in \mathcal{C}$ such that $x \in C_3 \subseteq (C_1 \cap C_2)$.\retTwo

   \begin{myIndent}\hThree
      Let $\mathcal{T}$ be the collection of open sets of $X$, and let $\mathcal{T}^\prime$ be the topology generated\\ by $\mathcal{C}$. Firstly, if $U \in \mathcal{T}$ and $x \in U$, there is by hypothesis $C \in \mathcal{C}$ such that $x \in C$ and $C \subseteq U$. So $U \subseteq \mathcal{T}^\prime$. Meanwhile, if $W \in \mathcal{T}^\prime$, then $W$ equals a union of elements of $\mathcal{C}$ by lemma 13.1. Since each element of $\mathcal{C}$ is in $\mathcal{T}$, we know $W$ is the union of elements of $\mathcal{T}$, meaning $W \in \mathcal{T}$.

\begin{myIndent}\hTwo
   Proof:\\
   ($\Longrightarrow$) Let $x \in X$ and $B \in \mathcal{B}$ such that $x \in B$. Since $B \in \mathcal{T}$ and we are assuming $\mathcal{T} \subseteq \mathcal{T}^\prime$, we know that $B \in \mathcal{T}^\prime$. Then since $\mathcal{B}^\prime$ generated $\mathcal{T}^\prime$, we know there is $B^\prime \in \mathcal{B}^\prime$ such that $x \in B^\prime \subseteq B$.\retTwo

   ($\Longleftarrow$)\\
   Given an element $U$ of $\mathcal{T}$, we need to show that $U \in \mathcal{T}^\prime$. To do this, consider any $x \in U$. Since $\mathcal{B}$ generates $\mathcal{T}$, there is an element $B \in \mathcal{B}$ such that $x \in B \subseteq U$. Now by hypothesis, there exists $B^\prime \in \mathcal{B}^\prime$ such that $x \in B^\prime \subseteq B$. So $x \in B^\prime \subseteq U$. Hence, $U \in \mathcal{T}^\prime$.\newpage

\blab{Lemma 13.4:} The topologies of $\mathbb{R}_l$ and $\mathbb{R}_K$ are strictly finer than the standard\\ topology on $\mathbb{R}$. But, they aren't comparable with one another.

\begin{myIndent}\hTwo
   Proof:\\
   Let $\mathcal{T}, \mathcal{T}^\prime, \mathcal{T}^\pprime$ be the topologies of $\mathbb{R}, \mathbb{R}_l, \mathbb{R}_K$ respectively.\retTwo

   Given any $(a, b) \in \mathcal{B}$ and $x \in (a, b)$, we know that $[x, b) \in \mathcal{B}^\prime$ and that\\ $x \in [x, b) \subseteq (a, b)$. So by lemma 13.3, $\mathcal{T} \subseteq \mathcal{T}^\prime$. On the other hand, for any\\ $[x, b) \in \mathcal{B}^\prime$, there is no set $(a, b) \in \mathbb{B}$ such that $x \in (a, b) \subseteq [x, b)$. So\\ $\mathcal{T}^\prime \not\subseteq \mathcal{T}$. Hence, $\mathcal{T}^\prime$ is strictly finer than $\mathcal{T}$.\retTwo

   Also, given any $(a, b) \in \mathcal{B}$, we also know that $(a, b) \in \mathcal{B}^\pprime$. So $\mathcal{T} \subseteq \mathcal{T}^\pprime$. On\\ the other hand, given $(-1, 1) - K \in \mathcal{B}^\pprime$, we know there is no interval\\ $(a, b) \in \mathcal{B}$ such that $0 \in (a, b) \subseteq (-1, 1) - K$. So by lemma 13.3, we know\\ that $\mathcal{T}^\pprime \not\subseteq \mathcal{T}$. Hence, $\mathcal{T}^\pprime$ is strictly finer than $\mathcal{T}$.\retTwo

   Finally, we show $\mathcal{T}^\prime$ and $\mathcal{T}^\pprime$ aren't comparable. Firstly, given the set $(-1, 1) - K$ in $\mathcal{B}^\pprime$, there is no set $[a, b) \in \mathcal{B}^\prime$ such that $0 \in [a, b) \subseteq (-1, 1) - K$. After all, for any $b > 0$, we can use the archimedean property to find $\frac{1}{n} < b$. Secondly, given the set $[0, 1) \in \mathcal{B}^\prime$, no set of the form $(a, b)$ can satisfy that $0 \in (a, b) \subseteq [0, 1)$. Similarly, no set of the form $(a, b) - K$ can satisfy that $0 \in (a - b) - K \subseteq [0, 1)$. So neither $\mathcal{T}^\prime \subseteq \mathcal{T}^\pprime$ nor $\mathcal{T}^\pprime \subseteq \mathcal{T}^\prime$.\retTwo\retTwo

   It suffices to show that the collection $\mathcal{B}$ of all finite intersections of elements of $\mathcal{S}$ is a basis.

   As for the second condition of a basis, given any $(S_1 \cap \ldots \cap S_n), (S_1^\prime \cap \ldots \cap S_m^\prime) \in \mathcal{B}$, we know that $(S_1 \cap \ldots \cap S_n) \cap (S_1^\prime \cap \ldots \cap S_m^\prime)$ is a finite intersection of elements of $\mathcal{S}$ and thus an element in $\mathcal{B}$.

      Next, suppose $\{U_\beta\}_{\beta \in B}$ is a collection of sets in $\mathcal{T}$. Since $\{U_\beta\}_{\beta \in B} \subseteq \mathcal{T}_\alpha$ for all $\alpha$, we know that $\bigcup\limits_{\beta \in B}U_\beta \in \mathcal{T}_\alpha$ for all $\alpha$. Hence, $\bigcup\limits_{\beta \in B}U_\beta \in \bigcap\limits_{\alpha \in A}\mathcal{T}_\alpha = \mathcal{T}$.\retTwo

      We know that $\{\mathcal{T}_\beta^\prime\}_{\beta \in B}$ is not empty because it must at least have $\mathcal{P}(X)$ as an element. Hence, we can apply part (a) of the problem to know that $\bigcap\limits_{\beta \in B}\mathcal{T}_\beta^\prime$ is a\\ [-8pt] topology on $X$.\retTwo

      Importantly, by virtue of being an intersection, that topology is smaller than all other topologies containing $\bigcup\limits_{\alpha \in A}\hspace{-0.2em}\mathcal{T}_\alpha$.

   Since $\mathcal{T} \subseteq \mathcal{T}^\prime$ for all $\mathcal{T}^\prime$ containing $\mathcal{A}$, we thus know that $\mathcal{T}$ is the unique\\ smallest topology containing $\mathcal{A}$. At the same time, by exercise 13.4.a, we know that\\ the intersection $\mathcal{T}^\pprime$ of all topologies containing $\mathcal{A}$ is a topology. By virtue of being\\ an intersection, we know it is smaller than all topologies containing $\mathcal{A}$, and that\\ it contains $\mathcal{A}$. So, $\mathcal{T} \subseteq \mathcal{T}^\pprime \subseteq \mathcal{T} \Longrightarrow \mathcal{T} = \mathcal{T}^\pprime$.\newpage

Prove the same if $\mathcal{A}$ is a subbasis.

\begin{myIndent}\exTwoP
   Let $\mathcal{T}$ be the topology generated by $\mathcal{A}$ and suppose $\mathcal{T}^\prime$ is any topology containing $\mathcal{A}$. Then consider any $U \in \mathcal{T}$. We know that $U = \bigcup\limits_{\beta \in B}U_\beta$ where $\{U_\beta\}_{\beta \in B}$ is a\\ [-11pt] collection of finite intersections of sets in $\mathcal{A}$.\retTwo

   Because each $U_\beta$ must be in $\mathcal{T}^\prime$, we thus know that $U \in \mathcal{T}^\prime$. So $\mathcal{T} \subseteq \mathcal{T}^\prime$.\retTwo

   The rest of the proof goes exactly the same as before.

If $X$ is simply-ordered, the standard topology for $X$ (called the \udefine{order topology}) is defined as follows:

\begin{myIndent}
   Given any $a, b \in X$ with $a < b$, we define the sets $(a, b)$, $[a, b)$, $(a, b]$ and $[a, b]$ as you would expect. These are the open, closed, and half-open intervals on $X$.\retTwo

   Now let $\mathcal{B}$ be the collection of all sets of the form:
   \begin{itemize}
      \item Open intervals $(a, b)$ in $X$.
      \item Intervals of the form $[a_0, b)$ where $a_0$ is the smallest element of $X$ (if one exists).
      \item Intervals of the form $(a, b_0]$ where $b_0$ is the largest element of $X$ (if one exists).\retTwo
   \end{itemize}

   The collection $\mathcal{B}$ is a basis for a topology on $X$ which is called the order\\ topology.
   
   \begin{myIndent}\hThree
      It's fairly trivial to show that this is a basis. It's just that for the second condition of a basis, there are a bunch of cases that need to be mentioned.\retTwo
   \end{myIndent}
\end{myIndent}

Another way we can define the order topology is through rays. Given any $a \in X$, we define the sets $(a, +\infty)$, $(-\infty, a)$, $[a, +\infty)$ and $(-\infty, a]$ as you would expect.\newpage

Let $\mathcal{S}$ be the set of open rays: $(a, +\infty)$ and $(-\infty, a)$. This is a subbasis for the order topology on $X$.

\begin{myIndent}
   To see this, firstly note that all open rays are open sets in the order topology of $X$. So, every set in the topology generated by $\mathcal{S}$ will be an open set in our original order topology. Hence if $\mathcal{T}$ is the order topology on $X$ and $\mathcal{T}^\prime$ is the topology generated by $S$, we know that $\mathcal{T}^\prime \subseteq \mathcal{T}$.\retTwo

   At the same time, every interval in the previously defined basis of $\mathcal{T}$ is the\\ intersection of two (or one if the interval contains the greatest or least\\ element of $X$) rays. Hence, $\mathcal{T} \subseteq \mathcal{T}^\prime$.\retTwo

A \udefine{law of compositon} on a set $S$ is map from $S \times S$ to $S$. Given the ordered pair $(a, b) \in S \times S$, we denote the element the pair is mapped to as either $ab$, $a \times b$, $a \circ b$, $a + b$, or etc. 

\begin{myIndent}
   Typically, $+$ is used if the composition is commutative. Meanwhile, the\\ multiplicative symbols don't imply commutativity.\retTwo
\end{myIndent}

\blab{Proposition 2.1.4:} Let an associative law of composition be given on $S$. Then we can uniquely define for all $n \in \mathbb{N}$ a product of $n$ elements $a_1, \ldots, a_n$ of $S$, temporarily denoted by $[a_1\cdots a_n]$, with the following properties:
\begin{itemize}
   \item[(i)] The product $[a_1]$ of one element is $a_1$.
   \item[(ii)] The product $[a_1a_2] $ of two elements is given by the law of composition.
   \item[(iii)] For any integer $i$ in the range $1 \leq i < n$, $[a_1\cdots a_n] = [a_1\cdots a_i][a_{i+1}\cdots a_n]$. 
   
   \begin{myIndent}\hTwo

      We proceed by induction on $n$.\retTwo

      Let us define $[a_1\cdots a_n] = [a_1\cdots a_{n-1}][a_n]$ and suppose that the analogous definition of $[a_1\cdots a_r]$ satisfies our properties for all $1 < r < n$. Then for any $1 \leq i < n - 1$, we have that:

      {\centering 
      \begin{tabular}{l l}
         $[a_1\cdots a_n] = [a_1\cdots a_{n-1}][a_n]$ & (by definition) \\

      \end{tabular} \newpage\par}

Based on the previous proposition, it's safe to just denote the product of $a_1, \ldots, a_n$ as $a_1\cdots a_n$.\retTwo

An identity for a law of composition is an element $e$ of $S$ satisfying that:

My goal for while I'm flying home and can't work on grading is to go prove the\\ following extra exercise of homework 2 in my math 188 class.\retTwo

Let $V = \{F(x) \in \mathbb{C}[[x]] : F(0) = 0\}$ and $W = \{F(x) \in \mathbb{C}[[x]] : G(0) = 1\}$.

\begin{enumerate}
	\item[(a)] Given $F(x) \in V$, show that $\bm{E}(F(x)) = \sum_{n \geq 0} \frac{F(x)^n}{n!}$ is the \textit{unique} formal power\\ [2pt] series $G(x) \in W$ such that $\Df G(x) = \Df F(x)\cdot G(x)$. This defines a function\\ [2pt] $\bm{E}: V \longrightarrow W$. 
	\begin{myIndent}
		Note that we use the convention $F(x)^0 = 1$ even if $F(x) = 0$.\newpage

		\exTwo
		Firstly, note that we have $G(x) \coloneq \bm{E}(F(x)) = \exp(F(x))$ where\\ $\exp(x) \coloneq \sum_{n \geq 0}\frac{x^n}{n!}$. Also, you can check $\exp(x)$ is it's own derivative.\\ Thus by chain rule:

		{\centering $G(x) = \Df F(x) \cdot \Df (\exp)(F(x)) = \Df F(x) \cdot \exp(F(x)) = \Df F(x) \cdot G(x)$ \retTwo\par}

		Next, suppose $H(x)$ is another formal power series in $W$ satisfying that\\ $\Df H(x) = \Df F(x) \cdot H(x)$. Note that since $H(0) \neq 0 \neq G(0)$, we can write that\\ $\frac{\Df H(x)}{H(x)} = \Df F(x) = \frac{\Df G(x)}{G(x)}$. Therefore, we get that:

		{\centering 
		\begin{tabular}{l l}
			\redPen{($*$)} & $\Df H(x) \cdot G(x) = \Df G(x) = H(x)$
		\end{tabular} \retTwo\par}

		Let $H(x) = \sum_{n \geq 0}h_nx^n$ and $G(x) = \sum_{n \geq 0}g_nx^n$. Since we assumed that\\ $H(x), G(x) \in W$, we know that $h_0 = g_0 = 1$. Then, proceeding by induction (assuming that $h_i = g_i$ for all $0 \leq i \leq n$), when we take the $n$th. coefficient of \redPen{($*$)} we get:

		{\centering\exP\begin{tabular}{l}
			$(n+1)h_{n+1} + \sum\limits_{i=0}^{n-1}(i+1)h_{i+1}g_{n-i}$\\
			$\phantom{aaaaaaaaaa} = \sum\limits_{i=0}^n (i+1)h_{i+1}g_{n-i} = \sum\limits_{i = 0}^n (i+1)g_{i+1}h_{n-i}$\\
			$\phantom{\phantom{aaaaaaaaaa} = \sum\limits_{i=0}^n (i+1)h_{i+1}g_{n-i}} = (n+1)g_{n+1} + \sum\limits_{i=0}^{n-1}(i+1)g_{i+1}h_{n-i}$
		\end{tabular}\retTwo\par}

		But by induction we have $\sum\limits_{i = 0}^{n-1}(i+1)g_{i+1}h_{n-i} = \sum\limits_{i=1}^{n-1}(i+1)h_{i+1}g_{n-i}$.\retTwo

		So subtracting out the sum from $i = 0$ to $n - 1$ and then dividing by $n + 1$ which is crucially nonzero, we then have that $h_{n+1} = g_{n+1}$.\retTwo
	\end{myIndent}

	\item[(b)] Given $G(x) \in W$, show that there is a \textit{unique} formal power series $F(x) \in V$ such that $\Df F(x) = \frac{\Df G(x)}{G(x)}$. This let's us define the function $\bm{L}: W \longrightarrow V$ by $\bm{L}(G(x)) = F(x)$.
	
	\begin{myIndent}\exTwo
		Since $G(0) = 1$, we know that $G(x)$ is invertible. So there is a unique formal power series $A(x) = \sum_{n \geq 0}a_n x^n$ such that $A(x) = \frac{\Df G(x)}{G(x)}$.\retTwo

		Then if $F(x) = \sum_{n \geq 0}f_nx^n$ satisfies that $\Df F(x) = \frac{\Df G(x)}{G(x)}$, then we can solve that $f_n = \frac{a_{n-1}}{n}$ for all $n \geq 1$. This shows that $f_n$ is uniquely determined for all $n \geq 1$. Also, since we are forcing $F(0) = 0$, we know that $f_0 = 0$. So $F(x)$ is a unique power series.\retTwo

		From this it's also hopefully clear to see how one can solve for $F(x)$ in order to show that $F(x)$ exists.\newpage
	\end{myIndent}

	\item[(c)] Show that $\bm{E}$ and $\bm{L}$ are inverses of each other.
	
	\begin{myIndent}\exTwo
		Firstly, we'll show $\bm{L}(\bm{E}(F(x))) = F(x)$ for all $F(x) \in V$.
		\begin{myIndent}\exTwoP
			Let $F(x) \in V$, $G(x) = \bm{E}(F(x))$, and $H(x) = \bm{L}(G(x))$. Then we have that:

			{\centering $\Df H(x) = \frac{\Df G(x)}{G(x)} = \frac{\Df F(x) \cdot G(x)}{G(x)} = \Df F(x)$ \retTwo\par}

			This proves that $[x^n]H(x) = [x^n]F(x)$ for all $n \geq 1$. And since both $H(x), F(x) \in V$, we know that $H(0) = F(0).$ so $H(x) = F(x)$.\retTwo
		\end{myIndent}

		Secondly, we'll show $\bm{E}(\bm{L}(F(x))) = F(x)$ for all $F(x) \in W$.
		\begin{myIndent}\exTwoP
			Let $F(x) \in V$, $G(x) = \bm{L}(F(x))$, and $H(x) = \bm{E}(G(x))$. Then we have that:

			Thus we know that $\Df H(x) \cdot F(x) = \Df F(x) \cdot H(x)$. Since both $H(x)$ and $F(x)$ are in $W$, we can employ identical logic as that of part (a) to show that $H(x) = F(x)$.\retTwo

	\item[(e)] Show that $\bm{L}(F_1(x)F_2(x)) = \bm{L}(F_1(x)) + \bm{L}(F_2(x))$ for all $F_1(x), F_2(x) \in W$.
	
	\begin{myIndent}\exTwo
		By part (d), we know that:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item $\bm{E}(\bm{L}(F_1(x)) + \bm{L}(F_2(x))) = \bm{E}(\bm{L}(F_1(x)))\bm{E}(\bm{L}(F_2(x)))$\retTwo

			\item $\bm{E}(\bm{L}(F_1(x)))\bm{E}(\bm{L}(F_2(x))) = F_1(x)F_2(x)$\retTwo
		\end{itemize}

		Hence, we've shown that $\bm{E}$ maps the left- and right-hand sides of the above claimed equation to the same formal power series. But from part (c) we know that $\bm{E}$ is an injective map. So we must have that the two sides of the equation are in fact equal.
	\end{myIndent}

	\item[(f)] If $m$ is a positive integer and $G(x) \in W$, show that $\bm{E}(\frac{\bm{L}(G(x))}{m})$ is an $m$th{.} root of $G(x)$.
	
	
	\begin{myIndent}\exTwo
		Let $F(x) = \bm{E}(\frac{\bm{L}(G(x))}{m})$. This implies $m \cdot \bm{L}(F(x)) = \bm{L}(G(x))$. Then by part\\ [3pt] (e), we know that $\bm{L}(F(x)^m) = \bm{L}(G(x))$. And finally, plugging both sides into\\ [3pt] $\bm{E}$ we get $F(x)^m = G(x)$.\retTwo

		Also, $F(0) = 1$. So $F(x)$ is the unique $m$th{.} root of $G(x)$ with $1$ as its constant coefficient.\retTwo

	Because of part (f), we can now extend our definition of the $z$th{.}\hspace{-0.1em} power of a\\ formal power series $G(x) \in W$ to any complex number $z$.

Then, we've shown in part (f) that this definition agrees with our more restricted definition from math 188 on at least the positive rational numbers.\retTwo

	Using those identities, here are some corollaries:\newpage

	\begin{itemize}		
		\item $G(x)^{-a}$ gives the multiplicative inverse of $G(x)^a$ 
		\begin{myDindent}\myComment
			(this proves that this definition of exponentiation agrees with our more restricted definition from math 188 on all rational numbers).
		\end{myDindent}
		
		\begin{myIndent}\exTwo
			Proof:\\
			Firstly note that:
			
			{\centering $G(x)^{-a}G(x)^a = G(x)^{-a + a} = G(x)^0 = \bm{E}(0 \cdot \bm{L}(G(x))) = \bm{E}(0)$\retTwo\par}

			Seconly, note that $\bm{E}(0) = \sum_{n \geq 0} \frac{0^n}{n!} = \frac{0^0}{0!} = 1$ (as a reminder we are using the convention that $0^0 = 1$). Therefore, $G(x)^{-a}G(x)^a = 1$, meaning $G(x)^{-a}$ is the multiplicative inverse of $G(x)^a$.\retTwo
		\end{myIndent}

		\item $V$ is a subgroup of $\mathbb{C}[[x]]$ under addition, $W$ is a group under multiplication, and $\bm{E}$ is a group isomorphism between $(V, +)$ and $(W, \cdot)$.
		
		\begin{myIndent}\exTwo
			Proof:\\
			One can easily see without our prior reasoning that $(V, +)$ is subgroup of $\mathbb{C}[[x]]$ under addition (with $0$ as it's identity). \retTwo

			Meanwhile, by our previous corollary we can see that all $G(x) \in W$ have a multiplicative inverse in $W$. Specifically since $G(x) = G(x)^{1}$, we know by the previous corollary that $G(x)$ has the inverse $G(x)^{-1}$ inside $W$.\\ Combining that with the fact that $1 \in W$ and $G(x)H(x) \in W$ when\\ $G(x), H(x) \in W$, we know now that $W$ is a group under multiplcation.\retTwo

			Finally, we know $\bm{E}$ is a group isomorphism because of part (c) of this\\ exercise as well as the fact that $\bm{E}(0) = 1$.\retTwo
		\end{myIndent}

		\item Power Rule: Given $G(x) \in W$, if $H(x) = G(x)^z$, then
		
		{\centering $\Df H(x) = z\Df G(x) G(x)^{z-1}$.\\ [-16pt]\par}
		
		\begin{myIndent}\exTwo
			Proof:

			{\centering
			\begin{tabular}{l}
				$\Df H(x) = \Df (\bm{E}(z \cdot \bm{L}(G(x))))(x)$\\ [4pt]

				$\phantom{\Df H(x)} = \Df(z \cdot \bm{L}(G(x)))(x)\cdot \bm{E}(z \cdot \bm{L}(G(x)))$\\ [4pt]

				$\phantom{\Df H(x)} = z\cdot\Df(\bm{L}(G(x)))(x)\cdot G(x)^z = z\frac{\Df G(x)}{G(x)}G(x)^z$\\ [4pt]

				$\phantom{\Df H(x) = z\cdot\Df(\bm{L}(G(x)))(x)\cdot G(x)^z} = z\Df G(x) G(x)^{-1} G(x)^z$\\ [4pt]

				$\phantom{\Df H(x) = z\cdot\Df(\bm{L}(G(x)))(x)\cdot G(x)^z} = z\Df G(x)G(x)^{z-1}$
			\end{tabular}\retTwo\par}
		\end{myIndent}

		\item Binomial Theorem: Given $z \in \mathbb{C}$, we have that:
		
		{\centering $(1 + x)^{z} = \sum\limits_{n \geq 0}\binom{z}{n}x^n$ where $\binom{z}{n} = \frac{z(z-1)\cdots(z-n+1)}{n!}$ when $n > 0$ and $1$\\ [-12pt] \phantom{aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa}when $n = 0$.\retTwo\par}

		\begin{myIndent}\exTwo
			Proof:\\
			Note that $[x^n](1 + x)^z = \frac{1}{n!}\Df^n((1+x)^z)(0)$. Also, by induction using the power rule we can say for $n > 0$ that:\newpage

			{\centering\begin{tabular}{l}
				$\Df^n((1+x)^z)(x) = z\Df^{n-1}((1+x)^z)(x)$\\
				
				$\phantom{\Df^n((1+x)^z)(x)} = z(z-1)\Df^{n-2}((1+x)^z)$\\
				
				$\phantom{\Df^n((1+x)^z)(x)} = \cdots = z(z-1)\cdots(z-n+1)(1+x)$
			\end{tabular}\retTwo\par}

			Therefore $\Df^n((1+x)^z)(0) = z(z-1)\cdots(z-n+1)(1+0)$ and we thus have that for $n > 0$.

			{\centering$[x^n](1 + x)^z = \frac{1}{n!}z(z-1)\cdots(z-n+1) = \binom{z}{n}$.\retTwo\par}

			Meanwhile, if $n = 0$, then $[x^0](1 + x)^z = 1 = \binom{z}{n}$ (because $(1 + x)^z \in W$).
		\end{myIndent}
	\end{itemize}

	Before going on to parts (g) and (h), here are two more identities (where\\ $F(x) \in V$, $G(x) \in W$, and $z \in \mathbb{C}$):
	\begin{itemize}
		\item $\left(\bm{E}(F(x))\right)^z = \bm{E}(z \cdot \bm{L}(\bm{E}(F(x)))) = \bm{E}(zF(x))$
		\item $\bm{L}(G(x)^z) = \bm{L}(\bm{E}(z \cdot \bm{L}(G(x)))) = z\bm{L}(G(x))$\retTwo
	\end{itemize}

	\item[(g)] Show that if $\sum_{i \geq 0}F_i(x)$ converges to $F(x)$, then $\prod_{i \geq 0}\bm{E}(F_i(x))$ converges to $\bm{E}(F(x))$.
	
	\begin{myIndent}\exTwo
		We start by proving the following lemma: If $A(x) \in \mathbb{C}[[x]]$ and $(B_i(x))_{i \in \mathbb{N}}$ is a\\ sequence in $\mathbb{C}[[x]]$ converging to $B(x)$ as $i \rightarrow \infty$ and satisfying that $B_i(0) = 0$\\ for all $i$, then $A(B_i(x)) \rightarrow A(B(x))$ as $i \rightarrow \infty$.

		\begin{myIndent}\exPP
			Proof:\\
			For notation, we'll denote:

			{\centering $A(x) = \sum_{n \geq 0}a_nx^n$,\phantom{..} $B_i(x) = \sum_{n \geq 0}b_n^{(i)}x^n$, and $B(x) = \sum_{n \geq 0}b_nx^n$\retTwo\par}

			To start, note that for all integers $m \geq 0$, we have that $B_i(x)^m \rightarrow B(x)^m$. Also, since $B_i(0) = 0$ for all $i$, we know that $\mdeg B_i(x)^m \geq m$ for all\\ integers $i$ and $m$, and also that $\mdeg B(x)^m \geq m$ for all integers $m$. Thus, fixing $n \geq 0$ we can say that:

			{\centering{\fontsize{11}{13}\selectfont $ [x^n]A(B_i(x)) = [x^n]\sum\limits_{m = 0}^n a_mB_i(x)^m$} and {\fontsize{11}{13}\selectfont $[x^n]A(B(x)) = [x^n]\sum\limits_{m = 0}^n a_mB(x)^m$ }\retTwo\par}

			Next, let $I_m$ be large enough that $[x^n]B_i(x)^m = [x^n]B(x)^m$ for all $i \geq I_m$. Then set $I = \max(I_0, I_1, \ldots, I_m)$ and note that for all $i \geq I$, we have:
			
			{\centering\fontsize{11}{13}\selectfont
			\begin{tabular}{l}
				$[x^n]\sum\limits_{m = 0}^n a_mB_i(x)^m = \sum\limits_{m = 0}^n a_m[x^n](B_i(x)^m)$\\ [11pt]
				$\phantom{[x^n]\sum\limits_{m = 0}^n a_mB_i(x)^m} = \sum\limits_{m = 0}^n a_m[x^n](B(x)^m) = [x^n]\sum\limits_{m = 0}^n a_mB(x)^m$ 
			\end{tabular}\retTwo\par}

			So for all $i \geq I$, we have that $[x^n]A(B_i(x)) = [x^n]A(B(x))$. This proves $A(B_i(x)) \rightarrow A(B(x))$.
			
			\begin{myDindent}\myComment
				I should have proved this in my math 188 notes when I was\\ showing that $((A + B) \circ C)(x) = (A \circ C)(x) + (B \circ C)(x)$\\ and $(AB \circ C)(x) = (A \circ C)(x)(B \circ C)(x)$. But in my defense the professor didn't mention any of these three facts in his notes.\newpage
			\end{myDindent}
		\end{myIndent}

		As a reminder: $\bm{E}(F(x)) = \exp(F(x))$ where $\exp = \sum_{n \geq 0}\frac{1}{n!}x^n$. Also, by our\\ previous lemma, we know that:\\ [-20pt]

		{\centering $\exp(F(x)) = \exp(\lim\limits_{n \rightarrow \infty}\sum\limits_{i = 0}^n F_i(x)) = \lim\limits_{n \rightarrow \infty}\exp(\sum\limits_{i = 0}^n F_i(x))$ \\ [4pt]\par}

		But then $\exp(\sum\limits_{i = 0}^n F_i(x)) = \bm{E}(\sum\limits_{i = 0}^n F_i(x)) = \prod\limits_{i=0}^n \bm{E}(F_i(x))$.\\
		
		So, we have shown that $\bm{E}(F(x)) = \lim\limits_{n \rightarrow \infty}\prod\limits_{i=0}^n \bm{E}(F_i(x)) = \prod\limits_{i\geq 0} \bm{E}(F_i(x))$\\ [-2pt]
	\end{myIndent}

	Side note: The lemma we proved in this part also tells us that if $(B_i(x))_{i \in \mathbb{N}}$ is a sequence in $V$ converging to $B(x)$, then $\bm{E}(B_i(x)) \rightarrow \bm{E}(B(x))$ as $i \rightarrow \infty$. In other words, $\bm{E}$ is a continuous map.
	
	\begin{myDindent}\myComment
		(If $\rho(A(x), B(x)) = \frac{1}{\mdeg (A - B)(x)}$, then $(\mathbb{C}[[x]], \rho)$ is a metric space in\\ which formal power series convergence is equivalent to convergence in\\ this metric space.)
	\end{myDindent}

	\item[(h)] Show that if $\prod_{i \geq 0}G_i(x)$ converges to $G(x)$, then $\sum_{i \geq 0}\bm{L}(G_i(x))$ converges to $\bm{L}(G(x))$.
	
	\begin{myIndent}\exTwo
		Unfortunately, unlike with $\bm{E}$ we do not (currently) have a formal power\\ series $A(x)$ for which we can generally say $\bm{L}(B(x)) = A(B(x))$. Thus, we\\ can't move the limit from inside $\bm{L}$ to outside $\bm{L}$ as easily as we did in part (g)\\ for $\bm{E}$.\\ [-12pt] 

		However, consider that $\lim\limits_{n \rightarrow \infty}\bm{E}(\sum\limits_{i = 0}^n \bm{L}(G_i(x)))$ exists. Specifically:
		
		{\centering\exP\begin{tabular}{l}
			$\lim\limits_{n \rightarrow \infty}\bm{E}(\sum\limits_{i = 0}^n \bm{L}(G_i(x))) = \lim\limits_{n \rightarrow \infty}\bm{E}(\sum\limits_{i = 0}^n \bm{L}(G_i(x)))$\\ [11pt]
			
			$\phantom{\lim\limits_{n \rightarrow \infty}\bm{E}(\sum\limits_{i = 0}^n \bm{L}(G_i(x)))} = \lim\limits_{n \rightarrow \infty} \prod\limits_{i=0}^n\bm{E}(\bm{L}(G_i(x))) = \lim\limits_{n \rightarrow \infty} \prod\limits_{i=0}^n G_i(x) = G(x)$
		\end{tabular}\retTwo\par}

		Thus, if we can show $\sum_{i\geq 0} \bm{L}(G_i(x))$ converges, then we can use the lemma from part (g) to see that:\\ [-14pt]

		{\centering $\bm{E}(\lim\limits_{n \rightarrow \infty}\sum\limits_{i = 0}^n \bm{L}(G_i(x))) = \lim\limits_{n \rightarrow \infty}\bm{E}(\sum\limits_{i = 0}^n \bm{L}(G_i(x))) = G(x)$,\\ [6pt]\par}

		and then by applying $\bm{L}$ to the left and right sides of this equation, we will get our desired result.\retTwo
		
		\begin{myIndent}\exTwoP
			We now show that $\sum_{i \geq 0}\bm{L}(G_i(x))$ converges. Firstly, note that after\\ [2pt] fixing $n \geq 1$, we have that:

			{\centering$[x^n](\bm{L}(G_i(x)))(x) = \frac{1}{n}[x^{n-1}]\frac{\Df G_i(x)}{G_i(x)}$.\newpage\par}
			
			
			Secondly, note that $\prod_{i \geq 0}G_i(x)$ converging to $G(x)$ and $G_i(0) = 1$\\ [2pt] for all $i$ implies that $\mdeg (G_i(x) - 1) \rightarrow \infty$ as $i \rightarrow \infty$ and\\ [2pt] thus $\mdeg \Df G_i(x) = \mdeg (G_i(x) - 1) - 1 \rightarrow \infty$ as $i \rightarrow \infty$.\retTwo
			
			
			Hence, there exists $I_n \geq 0$ such that $i \geq I_n$ implies that $[x^0]\Df G_i(x),$\\ $[x^1]\Df G_i(x), \ldots, [x^{n-1}]\Df G_i(x)$ are all $0$. In turn, we have for all $i \geq I_n$ that $[x^{n-1}](\Df G_i(x) \cdot \frac{1}{G_i(x)}) = 0$ and $[x^n](\bm{L}(G_i(x)))(x) = \frac{1}{n}\cdot 0 = 0$.\retTwo

			Since we also have by the definition of $\bm{L}$ that $(\bm{L}(G_i(x)))(0) = 0$ for all\\ $i$, we can thus conclude that: $\lim\limits_{i \rightarrow \infty} \mdeg(\bm{L}(G_i(x))) = 0$.\\ [0pt]

			This proves that $\sum_{i \geq 0}\bm{L}(G_i(x))$ converges.\retTwo
		\end{myIndent}
	\end{myIndent}

	To finish off, here is an identity: If $z, \alpha \in \mathbb{C}$ and $G(x) = (1-\alpha x)^z$, then\\ $\bm{L}(G(x)) = \sum\limits_{n \geq 1}\frac{-z}{n}\alpha^nx^n$.

	\begin{myIndent}\exTwo
		Proof:\\
		We already showed that $\bm{L}((1 - \alpha x)^z) = z\cdot \bm{L}(1 - \alpha x)$. Also:

		{\centering $\Df(\bm{L}(1-\alpha x))(x) = \frac{\Df(1 - \alpha x)}{1 - \alpha x} = -\alpha \sum\limits_{n \geq 0} \alpha^n x^n = \sum\limits_{n \geq 0}-\alpha^{n+1}x^n$ \\ [9pt]\par}

		Thus, we have that $z \cdot \bm{L}(1 - \alpha x) = z \cdot \sum\limits_{n \geq 1}\frac{-1}{n}\alpha^{(n+1)-1}x^n = \sum\limits_{n \geq 1}\frac{-z}{n}\alpha^n x^n$.\retTwo
	\end{myIndent}

	Some thoughts on this:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item $\bm{L}(\frac{1}{1-x}) = \sum_{n \geq 1}\frac{+1}{n}(1)^n x^n = \sum_{n \geq 1}\frac{1}{n}x^n$ which is importantly the same\\ as what we found in class.
		
		\item Given that $G(x)$ is a polynomial with constant coefficient $1$, we can combine this identity with part (e) to calculate $\bm{L}(G(x))$.
		\begin{myIndent}\exTwo
			Specifically, let $G(x) = (1 - \frac{1}{\gamma_1}x)\cdots(1-\frac{1}{\gamma_k}x)$ where $\gamma_1, \ldots, \gamma_k$ are the roots of $G(x)$. Since $G(0) = 1$ by assumption, we know that $\gamma_j \neq 0$ for all $j$. Then we have that:

			{\centering
			\begin{tabular}{l}
				$\bm{L}(G(x)) = \bm{L}((1 - \frac{1}{\gamma_1}x)\cdots(1-\frac{1}{\gamma_k}x))$\\ [6pt]

				$\phantom{\bm{L}(G(x))} = \bm{L}(1 - \frac{1}{\gamma_1}x) + \ldots + \bm{L}(1 - \frac{1}{\gamma_k}x)$\\ [-2pt]

				$\phantom{\bm{L}(G(x))} = \sum\limits_{n \geq 1}\frac{-1}{n}\gamma_1^{-n}x^n + \ldots + \sum\limits_{n \geq 1}\frac{-1}{n}\gamma_k^{-n}x^n = \sum\limits_{n \geq 1}\frac{-1}{n}\left(\vphantom{\int}\right.\hspace{-0.2em}\sum\limits_{j=1}^k \gamma_j^{-n}\hspace{-0.2em}\left.\vphantom{\int}\right)x^n$
			\end{tabular}\retTwo\par}
		\end{myIndent}
	\end{itemize}

	And now I'm out of ideas of what else to do with this homework problem.

Today and tomorrow I want to work through some of the exercises in Folland's \textit{Real Analysis} about the Cantor set and Cantor function. Assume for this section that $\mathbb{R}$\\ is equipped with the standard metric $\rho$ and that we are using the complete Lebesgue measure space $(\mathbb{R}, \mathcal{L}, m)$. \retTwo

If $I$ is a bounded interval and $\alpha \in (0, 1)$, then call the open interval with the same\\ midpoint as $I$ and length equal to $\alpha$ times the length of $I$ the "open middle $\alpha$th"\\ of $I$. If $(\alpha_j)_{j \in \mathbb{N}}$ is a sequence of numbers in $(0, 1)$, then we can define a decreasing\\ sequence $(K_j)_{j \in \mathbb{N}}$ of closed sets by setting $K_0 = [0, 1]$ and obtaining $K_j$ by\\ removing the open middle $\alpha_j$th from the intervals that make up $K_{j-1}$. Then\\ $K = \bigcap\limits_{j \in \mathbb{N}} K_j$ is called a \udefine{generalized Cantor set}.\\ [-16pt]

\begin{myTindent}\hThree
	The ordinary \udefine{Cantor set} $C$ is obtained by setting all $\alpha_j$ equal to $\sfrac{1}{3}$.\retTwo

\exOne
\blab{Exercise 2.27:} Let $K = \bigcap K_j$ be a generalized Cantor set created using the\\ sequence $(\alpha_j)_{j \in \mathbb{N}}$ in $(0, 1)$. Prove that $K$ is compact, perfect (i.e. closed and\\ has no isolated points), nowhere dense (i.e. not dense in any nonempty open\\ set), and totally disconnected (i.e. the only connected subsets of $K$ are single\\ points).

\begin{myIndent}\exTwoP
	\begin{itemize}
		\item $K$ is closed because it is an intersection of closed sets. Also, $K$ is a bounded set in $\mathbb{R}$ because it is a subset of $[0, 1]$. Thus, $K$ is compact.\retTwo
		
		\item Let $x \in K$. Then for any $\varepsilon > 0$, pick $J \in \mathbb{N}$ with $2^{-J} < \varepsilon$. Note that all intervals of $K_j$ have a length less than $2^{-j}$. After all, when going from $K_{j - 1}$ to $K_j$, we split all the intervals of $K_{j-1}$ in half and then remove an additional amount of length determined by $\alpha_j$. So, let $I$ be the interval of $K_J$ containing $x$. Then both endpoints of $I$ are in $K$ and also in $B(\varepsilon, x)$. And, at least one of those endpoints is not $x$. So $x$ is a limit point of $K$. Since $K$ is also closed, we have that $K$ is perfect.\retTwo
		
		\item Let $x, y \in K$ and without loss of generality assume $x < y$. Then we know there must exist some integer $J \in \mathbb{N}$ such that $x$ and $y$ are in different intervals of $K_J$. Afterall, as previously mentioned, points in the same interval of $K_j$ are within $2^{-j}$ distance of each other. So if no such $J$ exists, then $\rho(x, y) < 2^{-j}$ for all $j$, meaning $x = y$.\retTwo
		
		We can specifically choose $J$ to be the least integer such that $x$ and $y$ are in two different intervals of $K_J$.
