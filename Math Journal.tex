   My goal for today is to work through the appendix to chapter 1 in Baby Rudin. This appendix focuses on constructing the real numbers using Dedikind cuts.\retTwo
   
   \hTwo
   \begin{myIndent}
      We define a \udefine{cut} to be a set $\alpha \subset \mathbb{Q}$ such that:
      \begin{enumerate}
         \item $\alpha \neq \emptyset$
         \item If $p \in \alpha$,\myHS $q \in \mathbb{Q}$, and $q < p$, then $q \in \alpha$.
         \item If $p \in \alpha$, then $p < r$ for some $r \in \alpha$\newline
      \end{enumerate}

      Point 3 tells us that $\alpha$ doesn't have a max element. Also, point 2 directly implies the following facts:
      \begin{itemize}
         \item[a.] If $p \in \alpha$,\myHS $q \in \mathbb{Q}$, and $q \notin \alpha$, then $q > p$.
         \item[b.] If $r \notin \alpha$,\myHS $r, s \in \mathbb{Q}$, and $r < s$, then $s \notin \alpha$.\newline
      \end{itemize}

      As a shorthand, I shall refer to the set of all cuts as $R$.
      \begin{myIndent}\myComment
         An example of a cut would be the set of rational numbers less than $2$.\\
      \end{myIndent}

      Firstly, we shall assign an ordering to $R$. Specifically, given any $\alpha, \beta \in R$, we say that $\alpha < \beta$ if $\alpha \subset \beta$ (a proper subset).

      \begin{myIndent}\exTwo
         Here we prove that $<$ satisfies the definition of an ordering.
         \begin{itemize}
            \item[\mRoman{1}.] It's obvious from the definition of a proper subset that at most one of the following three things can be true: $\alpha < \beta$,\myHS $\alpha = \beta$, and $\beta < \alpha$.\retTwo
            
            Now let's assume that $a \not< \beta$ and $\alpha \not= \beta$. Then $\exists p \in \alpha$ such that $p \notin \beta$. But then for any $q \in \beta$, we must have by fact b. above that $q < p$. Hence $q \in \alpha$, meaning that $\beta \subset \alpha$. This proves that at least one of the following has to be true: $\alpha < \beta$,\myHS $\alpha = \beta$, and $\beta < \alpha$.\retTwo

            \item[\mRoman{2}.] If for $\alpha, \beta, \gamma \in R$ we have that $\alpha < \beta$ and $\beta < \gamma$, then clearly $\alpha < \gamma$ becuase $\alpha \subset \beta \subset \gamma$.\retTwo
         \end{itemize}
      \end{myIndent}

      Now we claim that $R$ equipped with $<$ has the least-upper-bound property.
      \begin{myIndent}\exTwo
         Proof:\\
         Let $A \subset R$ be nonempty and $\beta \in R$ be an upper bound of $A$. Then set\\ $\gamma = \hspace{-0.2em}\bigcup\limits_{\alpha \in A}\hspace{-0.2em}\alpha$. Firstly, we want to show that $\gamma \in R$\retTwo

         Since $A \neq \emptyset$, there exists $\alpha_0 \in A$. And as $\alpha_0 \neq \emptyset$ and $\alpha_0 \subseteq \gamma$ by definition, we know that $\gamma \neq \emptyset$. At the same time, we know that $\gamma \subset \beta$ since $\forall \alpha \in A$,\myHS $\alpha \subset \beta$. Hence, $\gamma \neq \mathbb{Q}$, meaning that $\gamma$ satisfies property 1$.$ of cuts.\retTwo

         Next, let $p \in \gamma$ and $q \in \mathbb{Q}$ such that $q < p$. We know that for some $\alpha_1 \in A$, we have that $p \in \alpha_1$. Hence by property 2$.$ of cuts, we know that $q \in \alpha_1 \subset \gamma$, thus showing that $\gamma$ satisfies property 2$.$ of cuts.\newpage
         
         Thirdly, by property 3$.$ we can pick $r \in \alpha_1$ such that $p < r$ and $r \in \alpha_1 \subset \gamma$. So, $\gamma$ satisfies property 3$.$ of cuts.\retTwo

         With that, we've now shown that $\gamma \in R$. Clearly, $\gamma$ is an upper bound of $A$ since $\alpha \subset \gamma$ for all $\alpha \in A$. Meanwhile, consider any $\delta < \gamma$. Then $\exists s \in \gamma$ such that $s \notin \delta$. And since $s \in \gamma$, we know that $s \in \alpha$ for some $\alpha \in A$. Hence, $\delta < \alpha$, meaning that $\delta$ is not an upper bound of $A$. This shows that $\gamma = \sup A$.\\ [6pt]
      \end{myIndent}

      Secondly, we want to assign $+$ and $\hspace{0.1em}\cdot\hspace{0.1em}$ operations to $R$ so that $R$ is an ordered field.\retTwo
      
      To start, given any $\alpha, \beta \in R$, we shall define $\alpha + \beta$ to be the set of all sums $r + s$ such that $r \in \alpha$ and $s \in \beta$.
      \begin{myIndent}\exTwo
         Here we show that $\alpha + \beta \in R$.
         \begin{enumerate}
            \item Clearly, $\alpha + \beta \neq \emptyset$. Also, take $r^\prime \notin \alpha$ and $s^\prime \notin \beta$. Then $r^\prime + s^\prime > r + s$ for all $r \in \alpha$ and $s \in \beta$. Hence, $r^\prime + s^\prime \notin \alpha + \beta$, meaning that $\alpha + \beta \neq \mathbb{Q}$.\\ [-9pt]
         \end{enumerate}

         Now let $p \in \alpha + \beta$. Thus there exists $r \in \alpha$ and $s \in \beta$ such that $p = r + s$.\\ [-9pt]

         \begin{enumerate}
            \item[2.] Suppose $q < p$. Then $q - s < r$, meaning that $q - s \in \alpha$. Hence,\\ $q = (q - s) + s \in \alpha + \beta$.\retTwo
            
            \item[3.] Let $t \in \alpha$ so that $t > r$. Then $p = r + s < t + s$ and $t + s \in \alpha + \beta$.\retTwo
         \end{enumerate}
      \end{myIndent}

      Also, we shall define $0^*$ to be the set of all negative rational numbers. Clearly, $0^*$ is a cut. Furthermore, we claim that $+$ satisfies the addition requirements of a field with $0^*$ as its $0$ element.

      \begin{myIndent}\exTwo
         Commutativity and associativity of $+$ on $R$ follows directly from the\\ commutativity and associativity of addition on the rational numbers.\retTwo

         Also, for any $\alpha \in R$,\myHS $\alpha + 0^* = \alpha$.
         \begin{myIndent}\exP
            If $r \in \alpha$ and $s \in 0^*$, then $r + s < r$. Hence $r + s \in \alpha$, meaning that $\alpha + 0^* \subseteq \alpha$. Meanwhile, if $p \in \alpha$, then we can pick $r \in \alpha$ such that $r > p$. Then, $p - r \in 0^*$ and $p = r + (p - r) \in \alpha + 0^*$. So, $\alpha \subseteq \alpha + 0^*$.\retTwo
         \end{myIndent}

         Finally, given any $\alpha \in R$, let $\beta = \{p \in \mathbb{Q} \mid \exists\hspace{0.1em} r \in \mathbb{Q}^+ \suchthat -p-r \notin \alpha\}$.
         \begin{myIndent}\myComment
            To give some intuition on this definition, firstly we want to guarentee that for all $p \in \beta$, $-p$ is greater than all elements of $\alpha$. Secondly, we add the $-r$ term to guarentee that $\beta$ doesn't have a maximum element.\\
         \end{myIndent}

         We claim that $\beta \in R$ and $\beta + \alpha = 0^*$. Hence, we can define $-\alpha = \beta$.

         \begin{myIndent}\exP
            To start, we'll show that $\beta \in R$:
            \begin{enumerate}
               \item For $s \notin \alpha$ and $p = -s - 1$, we have that $-p - 1 \notin \alpha$. Hence, $p \in \beta$, meaning that $\beta \neq \emptyset$. Meanwhile, if $q \in \alpha$, then $-q \notin \beta$ because there does not exist $r > 0$ such that $-(-q) - r = q - r \notin \alpha$. So $\beta \neq \mathbb{Q}$.\\ [-6pt]
            \end{enumerate}

            Now let $p \in \beta$ and pick $r > 0$ such that $-p -r \notin \alpha$.\newpage

            \begin{enumerate}
               \item[2.] Suppose $q < p$. Then $-q - r > -p - r$, meaning that $-q - r \notin \alpha$. Hence, $q \in \beta$.\retTwo
               
               \item[3.] Let $t = p + \frac{r}{2}$. Then $t > p$ and $-t - \frac{r}{2} = -p - r \notin \alpha$, meaning $t \in \beta$.\retTwo
            \end{enumerate}

            Now that we've proved $\beta \in R$, we next prove that $\beta$ is the additive inverse of $\alpha$. To start, suppose $r \in \alpha$ and $s \in \beta$. Then $-s \notin \alpha$, meaning that $r < -s$. So $r + s < 0$, thus showing that $\alpha + \beta \subseteq 0^*$.\retTwo

            As for the other inclusion, pick any $v \in 0^*$ and set $w = -\frac{v}{2}$. Then because $w > 0$, we can use the archimedean property of $\mathbb{Q}$ to say that there exists $n \in \mathbb{Z}$ such that $nw \in \alpha$ but $(n+1)w \notin \alpha$. Put $p = -(n + 2)w$. Then $p \in \beta$ because $-p - w = (n+1)w
            \notin \alpha$. And finally, $v = nw + p \in \alpha + \beta$. Thus, $0^* \subseteq \alpha + \beta$.\retTwo
         \end{myIndent}
      \end{myIndent}
   \end{myIndent}
   \dispDate{9/1/2024}
   \begin{myIndent}\hTwo
      Based on the definition of $+$, it's also hopefully clear that for any $\alpha, \beta, \gamma \in R$ such that $\alpha < \beta$, we have that $\alpha + \gamma < \beta + \gamma$.\retTwo

      Next, we shall define multiplication on $R$. Except, first we're going to limit ourselves to the set $R^+$ of all cuts greater than $0^*$. So, given any $\alpha, \beta \in R^+$, we shall define $\alpha \beta$ to be the set of all $p \in \mathbb{Q}$ such that $p \leq rs$ where $r \in \alpha$,\myHS $s \in \beta$,\myHS $r > 0$, and $s > 0$.

      \begin{myIndent}\exTwo
         Here we show that $\alpha\beta \in R^+$.
         \begin{enumerate}
            \item Clearly $\alpha\beta \neq \emptyset$. Also, take any $r^\prime \notin \alpha$ and $s^\prime \notin \beta$. Then $r^\prime s^\prime > rs$ for all $r \in \alpha \cap \mathbb{Q}^+$ and $s \in \beta \cap \mathbb{Q}^+$ since all four rational numbers are positive. By extension, $r^\prime s^\prime$ is greater than all the elements (both positive and negative) of $\alpha\beta$. So, $r^\prime s^\prime \notin \alpha\beta$, meaning that $\alpha\beta \neq \mathbb{Q}$.\\ [-9pt]
         \end{enumerate}

         Now let $p \in \alpha\beta$. Based on our definition of $\alpha\beta$, we know that the conditions of a cut trivially hold for any negative $p$. So, we'll assume from now on that $p > 0$. (Also note that a positive choice of $p$ must exist because both $\alpha$ and $\beta$ by assumption have positive elements.)\retTwo

         Since $p \in \alpha\beta \cap \mathbb{Q}^+$, we know there exists $r \in \alpha$ and $s \in \beta$ such that $p = rs$ and $r, s > 0$.

         \begin{enumerate}
            \item[2.] Suppose $0 < q < p$ (the case where $q \leq 0$ is trivial). Then $\frac{q}{s} < r$, meaning that $\frac{q}{s} \in \alpha$. So, $q = \frac{q}{s} \cdot s \in \alpha\beta$.\retTwo
            
            \item[3.] Let $t \in \alpha$ so that $t > r$. Then $p = rs < ts$ and $ts \in \alpha\beta$.\retTwo
         \end{enumerate}
      \end{myIndent}

      Also, we shall define $1^*$ to be the set of all rational numbers less than $1$. Clearly, $1^*$ is a cut. And we claim that $\hspace{0.1em}\cdot\hspace{0.1em}$ satisfies the multiplication requirements of a field with $1^*$ as its $1$ element.\newpage

      \begin{myIndent}\exTwo
         As before, commutativity and associativity of $\hspace{0.1em}\cdot\hspace{0.1em}$ on $R^+$ follows directly from commutativity and associativity of multiplication on the rational numbers.\retTwo

         Next, for any $\alpha \in R^+$, we have that $\alpha 1^* = \alpha$.
         \begin{myIndent}\exP
            It's clear that for any rational number $r \leq 0$, we have that $r \in \alpha 1^*$ and $r \in \alpha$. So we can exclusively focus on positive rational numbers.\retTwo
            
            Now suppose $r \in \alpha \cap \mathbb{Q}^+$ and $s \in 1^*$. Then $rs < r$, meaning that $rs \in \alpha$. So $\alpha 1^* \subseteq \alpha$. Meanwhile, if $p \in \alpha \cap \mathbb{Q}^+$, then we can pick $r \in \alpha$ such that $r > p$. Then $\frac{p}{r} \in 1^*$ and $p = \frac{p}{r} \cdot r \in \alpha 1^*$. So, $\alpha \subseteq \alpha 1^*$.\retTwo
         \end{myIndent}

         Thirdly, given any $\alpha \in R^+$, define:

         \begin{centering}
            $\beta = \{p \in \mathbb{Q} \mid p \leq 0\} \cup \{p \in \mathbb{Q}^+ \mid \exists r \in \mathbb{Q}^+ \suchthat \frac{1}{q} - r \notin \alpha\}$\retTwo\par
         \end{centering}

         \begin{myIndent}\exP
            Here we show that $\beta \in R^+$.
            \begin{enumerate}
               \item Clearly $\beta \neq \emptyset$. Also, if $q \in \alpha$, then $\frac{1}{q} \notin \beta$. Hence, $\beta \neq \mathbb{Q}$.\retTwo
            \end{enumerate}

            Now let $p \in \beta$ and pick $r > 0$ such that $\frac{1}{p} - r \notin \alpha$. Also, assume $p > 0$ because the proof is trivial if $p \leq 0$. (The fact that $p > 0$ in $\beta$ exists is trivial to show.)\retTwo

            \begin{enumerate}
               \item[2.] If $q \leq 0 < p$, then trivially $q \in \beta$. Meanwhile, if $0 < q < p$, then\\ [2pt] $\frac{1}{q} - r > \frac{1}{p} - r$, meaning that $\frac{1}{q} - r \notin \alpha$. Hence, $q \notin \beta$.\retTwo
               
               \item[3.] Let $t = \frac{1}{\frac{1}{p} - \frac{r}{2}}$. Then since $\frac{1}{p} - r \notin \alpha$, we know that $\frac{1}{p} - \frac{r}{2} > 0$. Also since $\frac{1}{t} = \frac{1}{p} - \frac{r}{2} < \frac{1}{p}$, we have that $t > p$. But note that $\frac{1}{t} - \frac{r}{2} = \frac{1}{p} - r \notin \alpha$.\\[2pt] Hence $t \notin \beta$.\retTwo
            \end{enumerate}
         \end{myIndent}

         We claim that $\beta\alpha = 1^*$. Hence, we can define $\frac{1}{\alpha} = \beta$.

         \begin{myIndent}\exP
            To start, suppose $r \in \alpha \cap \mathbb{Q}^+$ and $s \in \beta \cap \mathbb{Q}^+$. Then $\frac{1}{s} \notin \alpha$, meaning that\\ $r < \frac{1}{s}$. So $rs < 1$, thus showing that $\alpha\beta \subseteq 1^*$.\retTwo

            The other inclusion has a more complicated proof. Firstly, take any\\ $v \in 1^* \cap \mathbb{Q}^+$ (the proof is trivial if $v \leq 0$). Then set $w = \frac{1}{v}$, meaning\\ that $w > 1$. Now since $\alpha \in R^+$, we know there exists $n \in \mathbb{Z}$ such that\\ $w^n \in \alpha$ but $w^{n+1} \notin \alpha$. Then as $w^{n+2} > w^{n+1}$, we know that $\frac{1}{w^{n+2}} \in \beta$.\\ Hence, $v^2 = w^n \frac{1}{w^{n+2}} \in \alpha\beta$.\retTwo

            Now that we've shown that the square of every $v \in 1^* \cap \mathbb{Q}^+$ is also in $\alpha\beta$,\\ [2pt] we next show that there exists $z \in 1^* \cap \mathbb{Q}^+$ such that $z^2 > v$. Suppose $v = \frac{p}{q}$ where $p, q \in \mathbb{Z}^+$. Then set $z = \frac{p + q}{2q}$. Importantly, since $p < q$, we still have that $z \in 1^*$. But also note that:

            \begin{centering}
               $z^2 - v = \frac{p^2 + 2pq + q^2}{4q^2} - \frac{4pq}{4q^2} = \frac{p^2 - 2pq + q^2}{4q^2} = \left(\frac{p - q}{2q}\right)^2 \geq 0$\retTwo\par
            \end{centering}

            Thus as $v \leq z^2$ and $z^2 \in \alpha\beta$, we have that $v \in \alpha\beta$ as well. So $1^* \subseteq \alpha\beta$.\newpage
         \end{myIndent}

         Finally, so long as $\alpha, \beta, \gamma \in R^+$, we have that  $\alpha(\beta + \gamma) = \alpha\beta + \alpha\gamma$ because the rational numbers satisfy the distributive property.\retTwo
      \end{myIndent}

      Notably, in proving that $\alpha\beta \in R^+$ before, we also guarenteed that for $\alpha, \beta > 0$, we have that $\alpha\beta > 0$.\retTwo
   \end{myIndent} 

   \dispDate{9/7/2024}

   \begin{myIndent}

      Now we still need to extend our definition of multiplication from $R^+$ to all of $R$. To do this, set $\alpha 0^* = 0^*\alpha = 0^*$ and define:

      {\centering $\alpha \beta = \left\{
      \begin{matrix}
         (-\alpha)(-\beta) & \text{ if } \alpha < 0^*, \beta < 0^* \\
         -((-\alpha)\beta) & \text { if } \alpha < 0^*, \beta > 0^* \\
         -(\alpha(-\beta)) & \text{ if } \alpha > 0^*, \beta < 0^*
      \end{matrix}\right.$ \retTwo\par}

      Having done that, reproving those properties of multiplication on all of $R$ just\\ becomes a matter of addressing many cases and using the identity that\\ $(-(-\alpha)) = \alpha$.

      \begin{myIndent}\myComment
         Note that that identity can be proven just from the addition properties of a field.\retTwo
      \end{myIndent}

      Because I'm bored with this construction at this point, I'm going to skip reproving those properties.\retTwo

      So now that we've established that $R$ is a field, all we have left to do is to show that all numbers $r, s \in \mathbb{Q}$ are represented by cuts $r^*, s^* \in R$ such that:
      
      \begin{itemize}
         \item $(r + s)^* = r^* + s^*$
         \item $(rs)^* = r^*s^*$
         \item $r < s \Longleftrightarrow r^* < s^*$\retTwo
      \end{itemize}

      Again, I'm super bored and demotivated at this point. So, I'm going to skip showing this.\retTwo

      With all that done, we've now shown that $R$ satisfies all of the properties of real numbers. That concludes the proof of the existence theorem of the real numbers.

Then clearly $f$ is injective as\\ $\forall A, B \in \mathcal{P}(\mathbb{Z}_+)$, $f(A) = f(B) \Longrightarrow A = B$. Also, given any $\mathbf{x} \in X^\omega$, we\\ know that the set $A = \{i \in \mathbb{Z}_+ \mid \mathbf{x}_i = 1\}$ satisfies that $f(A) = \mathbf{x}$,\\ meaning $f$ is surjective.

      Now, the textbook recommends defining $h: A \longrightarrow B$ by:

            f(x) & & \text{ if } x \in A_n - B_n \text{ for any } n \in \mathbb{Z}_+ \\
            x & & \text{ otherwise }
         \end{matrix}\right.$\newpage
      \end{center}

      
      \begin{myIndent}
         \myComment I want to ask a professor about this definition because it urks me. My issue with\\ this definition of $h$ is that I feel like it should be possible for:
         $$\bigcap\limits_{n=1}^\infty (A_n \cap B_n) \neq \emptyset.$$
         
         However, we wouldn't be able to know that some $x$ is in that intersection and\\ thus falls into case 2 until after an infinite number of steps.\retTwo
         
         On the other hand, $S_1 = \bigcup\limits_{n = 1}^\infty (A_n - B_n)$ is a valid definition for a set, as is\\ $S_2 = A - S_1$. So the definition $h$ is valid because it's saying that $h(x) = f(x)$\\ [6pt] if $x \in S_1$ and $h(x) = x$ if $x \in S_2$.\retTwo

         Maybe my issue is just that I have trouble trusting the validity of a function definition if I can't actually evaluate that function myself. Although, there are lots of functions like that that I don't have any problem with. For example, given $g(x) = 0$ if $x$ is rational and $g(x) = 1$ if $x$ is irrational, what is $g(\pi^2)$?\retTwo
      \end{myIndent}

      Hopefully it is clear that $h$ is in fact a valid function from $A$ to $B$. Now firstly, we shall show that $h$ is injective.

      \begin{myIndent}\exP
         Let $x, y \in A$ such that $x \neq y$. If there are integers $n$ and $m$ such that $x \in A_n - B_n$ and $y \in A_m - B_m$, then $h(x) \neq h(y)$ because $f$ is injective. Meanwhile, if no such $n$ or $m$ exists, then $h(x) \neq h(y)$ because $x \neq y$.\retTwo

         This leaves the case that there exists $n \in \mathbb{Z}_+$ such that $x \in A_n - B_n$ but for\\ all $m \in \mathbb{Z}_+,\myHS y \notin A_m - B_m$. Then, note that $f(x) \in f(A_{n} - B_{n})$. And since\\ $f$ is injective, we thus have that $f(x) \in f(A_{n}) - f(B_{n}) = A_{n+1} - B_{n+1}$.\\ Therefore, as $y \notin A_{n+1} - B_{n+1}$, we know that $h(x) \neq y = h(y)$.\retTwo
      \end{myIndent}

      Next, we show $h$ is surjective.

      \begin{myIndent}\exP
         Let $y \in B$.\retTwo
         
         Suppose there exists $n \in \mathbb{Z}_+$ such that $y \in A_n - B_n$. We know that $n \neq 1$ since $y \in B$. Thus, there must exist $x \in A_{n-1}$ such that $y = f(x) \in f(A_{n-1}) = A_n$. Furthermore, this $x$ can't be in $B_{n-1}$ because otherwise $y$ would be in $B_n$ which we know isn't true. So, $x \in A_{n-1} - B_{n-1}$, meaning that $h(x) = f(x) = y$.\retTwo

         Meanwhile, if no such $n$ exists, then we simply have that $h(y) = y$. Hence,\\ $h(A) = B$.\retTwo
      \end{myIndent}

      Thus, we've shown that $h$ is a bijection, meaning that $|A| = |B|$.\newpage

   \blab{Exercise 7.7:} Show that $|\{0, 1\}^\omega| = |(\mathbb{Z}_+)^\omega|$.

   
   \begin{myIndent}\exTwo
      Firstly, there's obviously a bijection exists between $\{0, 1\}^\omega$ and $\{1, 2\}^\omega$. Also,\\ $\{1, 2\}^\omega \subset (\mathbb{Z}_+)^\omega$. So, if we can construct an injective function from $(\mathbb{Z}_+)^\omega$ to\\ $\{1, 2\}^\omega$, then we can apply the result of exercise 7.6.a to prove this exercise's\\ claim.\retTwo

      We shall create this injection using a diagonalization argument. Let $x \in (\mathbb{Z}_+)^\omega$.\\ Then we define $f(x) = y \in \{1, 2\}^\omega$ as follows:
      
      \begin{center}
         \begin{tabular}{c}
            $y(1) = 2$ if $x(1) = 1$. Otherwise $y(1) = 1$.\\ [6pt]

            $y(3) = 2$ if $x(2) = 1$. Otherwise $y(3) = 1$.\\ [6pt]
            $y(4) = 2$ if $x(1) = 3$. Otherwise $y(4) = 1$.\\
            $y(5) = 2$ if $x(2) = 2$. Otherwise $y(5) = 1$.\\
            $y(6) = 2$ if $x(3) = 1$. Otherwise $y(6) = 1$. \\ [6pt]

         We know $i \neq 1$ because $f(1) = a_0 = g(1)$. But then note that\\ $f|_{\{1, \ldots, i - 1\}} = g|_{\{1, \ldots, i- 1\}}$. Hence:

   \begin{myIndent}\myComment
      A few notes:
      \begin{enumerate}
         \item If we restrict $\mathcal{A}$ to being a finite collection, then there is nothing controversial about this axiom. It only becomes controversial when $\mathcal{A}$ is allowed to be infinite.
         \item There are multiple instances in baby Rudin where we made an infinite number of\\ arbitrary choices. Looking at a lot of those proofs closer, I think many of them could avoid using the axiom of choice by specifying that we had to pick rational numbers in a set. However, being able to pick elements without worrying about a preexisting choice function is way easier.\retTwo
         
         My take away from this is that not only does it make proofs cleaner to not worry about using constructed choice functions, but it's also perfectly acceptable now-a-days to use this axiom.\newpage
         
         Plus, some really commonly used theorems require the axiom of choice to prove them. For example, the union of countably many countable sets is countable. This makes it really easy to accidentally use the axiom of choice in a proof.\retTwo

   \begin{myIndent}\hTwo
      Proof:\\
      Given any set $B \in \mathcal{B}$, we define $B^\prime = \{(B, b) \mid b \in B\}$. Because $B \neq \emptyset$, we know that $B^\prime \neq \emptyset$ as well. Furthermore, given $B_1, B_2 \in \mathcal{B}$ if $B_1 \neq B_2$, then we have that the first element of all the pairs in $B_1^\prime$ are different from that of $B_2^\prime$. So $B_1^\prime$ and $B_2^\prime$ are disjoint.\retTwo

      Now form the collection $\mathcal{C} = \{B^\prime \mid B \in \mathcal{B}\}$. From before, we know that $\mathcal{C}$ is\\ a collection of disjoint sets. So by the axiom of choice, there exists a set $c$\\ consisting of exactly one element from each element of $\mathcal{C}$.\retTwo

But then that shows that $k + 1 \notin S$ since otherwise $k + 1$ would be the least element of $S$. Furthermore, since no element of $\{1, \ldots, k\}$ is in $S$, we automatically have that $k + 1 \in R$.\retTwo

         By induction, this means that $R = \mathbb{Z}_+$. Hence, we get a contradiction as $S$ must be empty.\newpage

         Let $S$ be a subset of $\mathbb{Z}_+$ such that $1 \in S$ and $k \in S \Longrightarrow k + 1 \in S$. Then suppose that $S \neq \mathbb{Z}_+$. In that case, we know that $S^\comp \neq \emptyset$, and since $\mathbb{Z}_+$ is well-ordered, we know there is a least element $\alpha$ of $S^\comp$.\retTwo

         Because $1 \in S$, we know that $\alpha \geq 2$. But then consider that $1 \leq \alpha - 1 < \alpha$. Therefore, $\alpha - 1 \in S$, thus implying that $\alpha \in S$. This contradicts that $\alpha \in S^\comp$.\retTwo

   Facts:
   \begin{itemize}
      \item If $A$ with the order relation $<$ is well-ordered, then any subset of $A$ is well-\\ordered as well with $<$ restricted to that subset.
      \item If $A$ has the order relation $<_1$ and $B$ has the order relation $<_2$ and both are well-ordered, then $A \times B$ is well-ordered with the dictionary order.
      \item Given any countable set $A$, we know there exists a bijection $f$ from $A$ to $\mathbb{Z}_+$. Hence, given $a, b \in A$, we can say that $a < b \Longleftrightarrow f(a) < f(b)$. Then, $A$ is well-ordered by $<$ with the least element of any subset $S$ of $A$ being the element $\alpha \in A$ such that $f(\alpha)$ is the least element in $f(S)$.
      \item If a set $A$ is well-ordered, then we can make a choice function $c: \mathcal{P}(A) \longrightarrow A$ using that well-ordering.

   An important theorem (which I will hopefully prove soon) is:
   
   \begin{myIndent}
      \blab{The Well Ordering Theorem:} If $A$ is a set, there exists an order relation on $A$ that is well-ordering.
      
      \begin{myIndent}\myComment

   \exOne\blab{Exercise 10.5:} Show that the well-ordering theorem implies the (infinite) axiom of choice.
   \begin{myIndent}\exTwo
      Let $\mathcal{A}$ be a collection of disjoint sets. By the well-ordering theorem, we can pick an order relation on $\bigcup\limits_{A \in \mathcal{A}}A$ that is well-ordering.\newpage
      
      \begin{myIndent}\myComment
         Note that the previous sentence is carefully worded to only make use of the finite axiom of choice. Specifically, the order relation we are picking is an element of some subset of $\bigcup\limits_{A \in \mathcal{A}}A \times \bigcup\limits_{A \in \mathcal{A}}A$.\retTwo

         If we had instead picked a well-ordering for each $A \in \mathcal{A}$, then that would require the axiom of choice as we would be making potentially infinitely many arbitrary choices of order relations.\retTwo

      Now let $C = \{a \in \hspace{-0.2em}\bigcup\limits_{A \in \mathcal{A}}\hspace{-0.2em}A \mid \exists A \in \mathcal{A} \suchthat a \in A \text{ and } \forall b \in A,\myHS a \leq b \}$.\retTwo Then $C$ fulfils the properties of the set that the axiom of choice would guarentee exists.\retTwo

      Let the set $A$ with the order relation $<$ be well-ordered. Then consider any nonempty $B \subseteq A$ and suppose there exists $\alpha \in A$ such that $b < \alpha$ for all $b \in B$.\retTwo

      Let $U = \{a \in A \mid \forall b \in B, \myHS b \leq a\}$. Since $\alpha \in U$, we know that $U \neq \emptyset$. So, because $A$ is well-ordered, we know that $U$ has a least element $\beta$. This $\beta$ is by definition the least upper bound of $B$. So $\sup{B} = \beta$.\retTwo\retTwo

      Starting off, let $B$ be an uncountable well-ordered set. Then let $C$ be the well-\\ordered set $\{1, 2\} \times B$ with the dictionary order.

         The reason we are considering $\{1, 2\} \times B$ instead of just $B$ is that if we were just considering $B$, then we wouldn't be able to guarentee that there exists $b \in B$ such that $S_b$ is uncountable.\newpage

Furthermore, all sections of $S_{(2, 1)}$\\ are finite. Thus, $S_{(2, 1)}$ would be a minimal \textit{countable} well-ordered set.\retTwo

   \begin{myIndent}\hTwo
      Proof:\\
      Let $A$ be a countable subset of $S_\Omega$. For all $a \in A$, we know that $S_a$ is countable. Therefore, $B = \bigcup\limits_{a \in A}S_a$ is also countable, meaning that $S_\Omega - B \neq \emptyset$.\retTwo

      If we pick $x \in S_\Omega - B$, we must have that $x$ is an upper bound to $A$ because if $x < a$ for some $a \in A$, we would have that $x \in S_a \subseteq B$.\retTwo

      \begin{myIndent}\exTwo
         Let $A$ be a well-ordered set and let $\alpha$ be any element in $A$ such that there exists $\beta \in A$ for which $\alpha < \beta$. Then consider the set $S = \{x \in A \mid \alpha < x < \beta\}$. If $S = \emptyset$, then we know $\alpha$ has $\beta$ as its successor. Meanwhile, if $S \neq \emptyset$, then since $A$ is well-ordered, we know that $A$ has a least element $\gamma$. Thus, the set $\{x \in A \mid \alpha < x < \gamma\} = \emptyset$ and we know that $\gamma$ is the successor of $\alpha$.\retTwo

       \begin{myIndent}\exTwo
         Consider the set $\mathbb{Z}$ of all integers using the standard ordering. Then for any $n \in \mathbb{Z}$, we know that its successor is $n + 1$. At the same time though, the set of all negative integers has no least element. So $\mathbb{Z}$ is not well-ordered by $<$.\retTwo\retTwo

   \begin{itemize}
      \item[(c)] Let $X_0$ be the subset of $S_\Omega$ consisting of all elements $x$ such that $x$ has no\\ immediate predecessor. Show that $X_0$ is uncountable.
      
      \begin{myIndent}\exTwo
         Suppose $X_0$ is bounded above by some $\alpha \in S_\Omega$. Thus, there is a predecessor $x \in S_\Omega$ for any $y$ in the set $T = \{z \in S_\Omega \mid z > \alpha\}$.\newpage

         Now define a function $f: \mathbb{Z}_+ \longrightarrow T$ such that $f(1) =$ the least element of $T$ and $f(n) =$ the successor of $f(n - 1)$ for all $n > 1$. We know this function is well-defined because $S_\Omega$ has no largest element according to exercise 10.6.a. So, all elements of $S_\Omega$ and thus $T$ have a successor by exercises 10.2.a, meaning our formula for $f(n)$ is always defined no matter what $f(n-1)$ is. Hence, the principle of recursive definition guarentees a unique $f$ exists.\retTwo

         Now it's easy to show that $f$ is injective. For suppose that given some $x, n \in \mathbb{Z}_+$ we had that $f(x) = f(x + n)$. Then that would mean that:

         {\centering $f(x) < f(x + 1) < \cdots < f(x + n - 1) < f(x + n) = f(x) $\retTwo\par}

         Hence we have a contradiction as $f(x) < f(x)$.\retTwo

         Next, we show that $f$ is surjective. Suppose the set $R = T - f(\mathbb{Z}_+) \neq \emptyset$. Then since $S_\Omega$ and hence $T$ is well-ordered, we know that $R$ has a least element $\beta$. But note that $\beta$ has a predecessor $\gamma$ which isn't in $R$. More specifically, since we know that the least element of $T$ is in $f(\mathbb{Z}_+)$, we know that $\gamma$ is at least the least of element of $T$. So $\gamma \in T$.\retTwo

         Thus we conclude that $\gamma \in T - (T - f(\mathbb{Z}_+)) = f(\mathbb{Z}_+)$, meaning there exists $N$ such that $f(N) = \gamma$. But this means that $f(N + 1) = \beta$, which contradicts that $\beta$ is the least element of $R$.\retTwo

         With that, we've now shown that $f: \mathbb{Z}_+ \longrightarrow T$ is a bijection, meaning that $T$ is countable. However, this contradicts exercise 10.6.b. which asserts that $T$ is uncountable.\retTwo

         Therefore, we conclude that $X_0$ cannot be bounded above. And by theorem 10.3, that means that $X_0$ can't be a countable subset of $S_\Omega$.\retTwo

      \begin{myIndent}\exTwo
         ($\Longleftarrow$)\\
         If for some $B \subseteq A$, we have that $f: \mathbb{Z}_- \longrightarrow B$ is an order preserving bijection, then we must have that $B$ has no least element. Hence, not all subsets of $A$ have a least element, meaning that $A$ is not well-ordered.\retTwo

         ($\Longrightarrow$)\\
         If $A$ is not well ordered, then we know there is a set $B \subseteq A$ with no least element. Now using the axiom of choice, choose any $\beta_1 \in B$. Then for all\\ $n > 1$, choose $\beta_n \in B_{\beta_{n-1}}$. In other words, choose $\beta_n \in B$ such that\\ $\beta_n < \beta_{n-1}$.\newpage
         
         Finally, define $f: \mathbb{Z}_- \longrightarrow \{\beta_n \mid n \in \mathbb{Z}_+\}$ by the rule: $f(n) = \beta_{-n}$. This $f$ is an order preserving bijection. Thus, the set $\{\beta_n \mid n \in \mathbb{Z}_+\} \subseteq A$ has the same order type as $\mathbb{Z}_-$.\retTwo

Clearly, $B$ has no least element. Also, the function $g(n) = f(-n)$ gives a bijection from $\mathbb{Z}_+$ to $B$, meaning that $B$ is countable.

   \begin{myTindent}\hThree
      In other words, there exists a subset $B$ of $A$ such that $B$ is simply ordered by $\prec$ and no subset of $A$ that properly contains $B$ is simply ordered by $\prec$.\retTwo

   \begin{myIndent}\hTwo
      Proof:\\
      To start out, let $J$ be a set well-ordered by $<$ such that the elements of $A$\\ are indexed in a bijective fashion by the elements of $J$. In other words,\\ $A = \{a_\alpha \in A \mid \alpha \in J\}$.
      \begin{myIndent}\myComment
         Assuming the well-ordering theorem, we know that $J$ exists. Specifically let $J$ refer to the same set as $A$ but equip $J$ with the well-ordering $<$ that we know exists instead of the partial ordering $\prec$ which we equipped $A$.\retTwo

      Now our goal is to construct a function $h: J \longrightarrow \{0, 1\}$ such that $h(\alpha) = 1$ if $a_\alpha$\\ is in our maximal simply ordered subset of $A$ and $h(\alpha) = 0$ otherwise. To do this, we rely on the \textbf{general principle of recursive definition}.\retTwo

               Let $J$ be a well-ordered set and $C$ be any set. Given a\newline function $\rho: \mathcal{F} \longrightarrow C$ where $\mathcal{F}$ is the set of all functions\newline mapping sections of $J$ into $C$, we have that there exists a\newline unique functon $h: J \longrightarrow C$ satisfying that $h(\alpha) = \rho(h|_{S_\alpha})$\newline for all $\alpha \in J$.

      Given any $\alpha \in J$ and $f: S_\alpha \longrightarrow \{0, 1\}$, define $\rho(\alpha) = 1$ if $a_\alpha \in A$ is comparable to all $a_\beta \in A$ such that $\beta \in f^{-1}(1)$ (the preimage of $1$).

      Then by the general principle of recursive definition, we know a unique function $h: J \longrightarrow \{0, 1\}$ exists such that for all $\alpha \in J$, we have that $h(\alpha) = 1$ only when $a_\alpha$ is comparable to all $a_\beta \in A$ such that $\beta \in S_\alpha$ and $h(\beta) = 1$.\retTwo

      Let $B = \{a_\alpha \in A \mid \alpha \in J \text{ and } h(\alpha) = 1\}$. Then given any $a_\alpha, a_\beta \in B$ such that $\alpha < \beta$, we know that either $a_\alpha \prec a_\beta$ or $a_\beta \prec a_\alpha$. Hence, $B$ is simply ordered by $\prec$. At the same time, if $a_\gamma \notin B$, then we know $h(\gamma) = 0$, meaning there exists $a_\alpha \in B$ such that $\alpha < \gamma$ and  $a_\gamma$ is not comparable to $a_\alpha$. This shows that any set properly containing $B$ is not simply ordered by $\prec$.

   Let $A$ be a set and let $\prec$ be a strict partial order on $A$.

      Proof:\\
      By the Hausdorff maximum principle, there exists a maximal simply ordered subset $B$ of $A$. Let $c$ be an element of $A$ that is an upperbound to $B$. We claim that $c$ is a maximal element of $A$. For suppose there exists $d \in A$ such that $c \prec d$. We know $d \notin B$ since that would imply $d \prec c$. But by the transitivity of $\prec$, we know that $b \preceq c \prec d \Longrightarrow b \prec d$ for all $b \in B$. Hence, $B \cup \{d\}$ is simply ordered by $\prec$. This contradicts that $B$ is a maximal simply ordered subset of $A$.\retTwo\retTwo

   \begin{itemize}\exTwo
      \item It's easy to show that $\prec$ is a strict partial order. After all, for all $a \in \mathbb{R}$, we have that $a - a$ is not positive. Also, if $a \prec b$ and $b \prec c$, then we know that $b - a = p$ and $c - b = q$ where $p, q \in \mathbb{Q}_+$. But then $c - a = c - b + b - a = p + q \in \mathbb{Q}_+$. So $a \prec c$.\retTwo

   \pracOne\mySepTwo

   \blab{Tangent:} I never got around to writing this down last quarter. So here's a proof that\\ assuming the axiom of choice, non-Lebesgue measurable sets exist.
   
   \begin{myIndent}\pracTwo
      Let $\mathcal{B}$ be the collection of sets of the form $S_x = [0, 1] \cap \{x + p \mid p \in \mathbb{Q}\}$ where $x$ is any real number. Obviously, all the sets in $\mathcal{B}$ are nonempty. We also claim that all the sets in $\mathcal{B}$ are disjoint. For suppose $S_x, S_y \in \mathcal{B}$ and $S_x \cap S_y \neq \emptyset$. Then fix $c \in S_x \cap S_y$ and consider any $a \in S_x$ and $b \in S_y$.\retTwo

      We know $c - x = p_1$, $a - x = p_2$, $c - y = q_1$, and $b - y = q_2$ where $p_1, p_2, q_1, q_2 \in \mathbb{Q}$. Thus, we have that $a - y = (a - x) + (x - c) + (c - y) = p_2 - p_1 + q_1 \in \mathbb{Q}$. Similarly, we have that $b - x = (b - y) + (y - c) + (c - x) = q_2 - q_1 + p_1 \in \mathbb{Q}$. This tells us that $a \in S_y$ and $b \in S_x$. And since this works for all $a \in S_x$ and $b \in S_y$, we thus must have that $S_x = S_y$.\retTwo

      Now using the axiom of choice, let $V$ be a set containing one element from each set in $\mathcal{B}$.\retTwo

      To show that $V$ is nonmeasurable, we'll reach a contradiction by supposing $V$ is\\ measurable. Let $q_1, q_2, \ldots$ be an enumeration of all the rational numbers in the set $[-1, 1]$. Then having defined $V + q_n = \{v + q_n \mid v \in V\}$, consider the set: $\hspace{-0.3em}\bigcup\limits_{n \in \mathbb{Z}_+}\hspace{-0.3em}(V + q_n)$.\\

      Obviously, since $V \subseteq [0,1]$, we know that $\hspace{-0.3em}\bigcup\limits_{n \in \mathbb{Z}_+}\hspace{-0.3em}(V + q_n) \subseteq [-1, 2]$.\\

      Also, consider any $x \in [0, 1]$ and let $v$ be the element of $V$ which was chosen from the set $S_x \in \mathcal{B}$. Then $v - x = p$ where $p$ is some rational number in $[-1, 1]$. So, we also know that $[0, 1] \subseteq \hspace{-0.3em}\bigcup\limits_{n \in \mathbb{Z}_+}\hspace{-0.3em}(V + q_n)$. This means that $1 \leq \mu(\hspace{-0.3em}\bigcup\limits_{n \in \mathbb{Z}_+}\hspace{-0.3em}(V + q_n)) \leq 3$.\\

      But now note that for any $n, m \in \mathbb{Z}_+$, we have that $n \neq m \Longrightarrow V + q_n \cap V + q_m = \emptyset$. To prove this, assume $V + q_n \cap V + q_m \neq \emptyset$. Thus, there would exist $v, u \in V$ such that $v + q_n = u + q_m$. In turn, we'd have that $v - u = q_m - q_n \in \mathbb{Q}$, which means that\\ $v \in S_u$. However, this contradicts that $V$ has only one element of $S_u$.\\ [-4pt]

      Now since $\mu$ is countably additive, we have that $\mu(\hspace{-0.3em}\bigcup\limits_{n \in \mathbb{Z}_+}\hspace{-0.3em}(V + q_n)) = \sum\limits_{n = 1}^\infty \mu(V + q_n)$.\\
      
      Finally, note that $\mu(V) = \mu(V + q_n)$ for all $n$. Thus $\sum\limits_{n = 1}^\infty \mu(V + q_n) = \sum\limits_{n = 1}^\infty \mu(V)$ is either\\ [-6pt] $0$ or $\infty$.\retTwo
      
      But this contradicts our earlier finding that the measure was between $1$ and $3$. So, we conclude that $V \notin \mathfrak{M}(\mu)$. $\blacksquare$

   \begin{myIndent}
      \blab{Kuratowski's Lemma:} Let $\mathcal{A}$ be a collection of sets. Suppose that for every subcollection $\mathcal{B}$ of $\mathcal{A}$ that is simply ordered by proper inclusion, the union of the elements of $\mathcal{B}$ belongs to $\mathcal{A}$. Then $\mathcal{A}$ has an element that is properly contained in no other element of $\mathcal{A}$.\retTwo
      
      \begin{myIndent}\exTwo\color{RedViolet}
         To be clear, given any $A, B \in \mathcal{A}$, we defined above that $A \prec B$ if $A \subset B$. Importantly, our assumption about $\mathcal{A}$ means that every subcollection $\mathcal{B}$ of $\mathcal{A}$ that is simply ordered by $\prec$ has an upper bound in $\mathcal{A}$: $\bigcup\limits_{B \in \mathcal{B}}\hspace{-0.2em}B$.\retTwo
         
         Thus by Zorn's lemma, we know that $\mathcal{A}$ has a maximal element $C$. And since there is no element $D \in \mathcal{A}$ such that $C \prec D$, we know that $C$ is properly contained by no sets in $\mathcal{A}$.\retTwo

   \end{myIndent}

   \blab{Exercise 11.6:} A collection $\mathcal{A}$ of subsets of a set $X$ is said to be of \textit{finite type}\\ provided that a subset $B$ of $X$ belongs to $\mathcal{A}$ if and only if every finite subset\\ of $B$ belongs to $\mathcal{A}$. Show that the Kuratowski lemma implies the following:

   
   \begin{myIndent}
      \blab{Tukey's Lemma:} Let $\mathcal{A}$ be a collection of sets. If $\mathcal{A}$ is of finite type, then $\mathcal{A}$ has an element that is properly contained in no other element of $\mathcal{A}$.\newpage
      
      \begin{myIndent}\exTwo\color{RedViolet}
         To start off I want to clarify that $\mathcal{A}$ being of finite types means both that:
         \begin{enumerate}
            \item[1.] For each $A \in \mathcal{A}$, every finite subset of $A$ belongs to $\mathcal{A}$.
            \item[2.] If every finite subset of a given set $A$ belongs to $\mathcal{A}$, then $A$ belongs to $\mathcal{A}$.\\
         \end{enumerate}

         Now let $\mathcal{B}$ be any subcollection of $\mathcal{A}$ that is simply ordered by proper\\ inclusion. Next, consider the set $S = \bigcup\limits_{B \in \mathcal{B}}B$. We want to show that any\\ [-8pt] finite subset of $S$ is in $\mathcal{A}$.\retTwo

         To do this, let $n \in \mathbb{Z}_+$ and consider any subset $\{b_1, b_2, \ldots, b_n\}$ of $S$ with $n$ elements. Note that for each $1 \leq i \leq n$, there exists $B_i \in \mathcal{B}$ such that $b_i \in B_i$. Then since $\{B_1, B_2, \ldots B_n\}$ is a simply ordered finite set, we know that it has a maximum element $B_m$ such that $B_i \subseteq B_m$ for all $i$. Hence, we have that $\{b_1, b_2, \ldots b_n\}$ is contained by some $B_m$ in $\{B_1, B_2, \ldots, B_n\} \subseteq \mathcal{B}$. Because $\mathcal{A}$ is of finite type, this tells us that $\{b_1, b_2, \ldots b_n\} \in \mathcal{A}$.\retTwo

         Since we showed above that any finite subset of $S$ is in $\mathcal{A}$, we can thus conclude because $\mathcal{A}$ is of finite type that $S \in \mathcal{A}$. And so, we have now proven the hypothesis of Kuratowski's lemma, meaning that $\mathcal{A}$ must have a set that is properly contained in other element of $\mathcal{A}$.\retTwo

      Let $A$ be a set with the strict partial order $\prec$. Then let $\mathcal{A}$ be the collection of all subsets of $A$ that are simply ordered by $\prec$. We shall show below that $\mathcal{A}$ is of finite type.
      
      \begin{enumerate}
         \item Suppose $B \in \mathcal{A}$. Then given any subset $C$ of $B$ (finite or not), we know that $C$ is also simply ordered by $\prec$. So $C \in \mathcal{A}$.
         \item Let $B \subseteq A$ and suppose every finite subset of $B$ is in $\mathcal{A}$. Then given any two different elements $b_1, b_2 \in B$, we know that $\{b_1, b_2\} \in \mathcal{A}$, meaning that either $b_1 \prec b_2$ or $b_2 \prec b_1$. In other words, $B$ is simply ordered by $\prec$, meaning that $B \in \mathcal{A}$.\retTwo

      Because $\mathcal{A}$ is of finite type, we know that $\mathcal{A}$ has an element that is properly\\ contained in no other element of $\mathcal{A}$.

\blab{Exercise 1: (General principle of recursive definition)}
\begin{myIndent}\exTwo\color{RedViolet}
   We already addressed this before. I'm skipping proving this because the proof is mostly identical to exercise 10.10.\retTwo
\end{myIndent} 

\blab{Exercise 2:} 
\begin{itemize}
   \item[(a)] Let $J$ and $E$ be well-ordered sets and let $h: J \longrightarrow E$. Show that the following two statement are equivalent:
   \begin{enumerate}
      \item[(i)] $h$ is order preserving and its image is $E$ or a section of $E$.
      \item[(ii)] $h(\alpha) = \text{smallest}(E - h(S_\alpha))$ for all $\alpha \in J$. 
      
      \begin{myIndent}\exTwo\color{RedViolet}
         (i) $\Longrightarrow$ (ii):\\
         Given any $\alpha \in J$, we know that $h(\alpha)$ must be an upper bound to $h(S_\alpha)$. Now suppose $\exists \beta \in S_{h(\alpha)}$ such that $\beta \notin h(S_\alpha)$. Because of our assumption about the image of $h$, we know that $\beta \in h(J)$, meaning there exists $\gamma \in J$ such that $h(\gamma) = \beta$. But because $h$ is order-preserving, we must have that $\beta < f(\alpha) \Longrightarrow \gamma < \alpha$. This contradicts that $\beta \notin h(S_\alpha)$.\retTwo

         With that, we've now shown that $h(S_\alpha) = S_{h(\alpha)}$. In turn, this shows that $h(\alpha)$ is the smallest element in $E - h(S_\alpha)$.\retTwo

         (ii) $\Longrightarrow$ (i):\\
         It's easy to show $h$ is order preserving. Let $\alpha, \beta \in J$ such that $\alpha < \beta$.\\ Then $h(S_\alpha) \subset h(S_\beta)$, meaning that $E - h(S_\beta) \subset E - h(S_\alpha)$. And\\ since the least element of $E - h(S_\alpha)$ is not in $E - h(S_\beta)$, that means that\\ $h(\alpha) = \text{smallest}(E - h(S_\alpha)) < \text{smallest}(E - h(S_\beta)) = h(\beta)$.\newpage

         As for showing the other property of $h$, let $J_0 = \{\alpha \in J \mid h(S_\alpha) = S_{h(\alpha)}\}$. Now suppose that for some $\alpha \in J$, we have that $S_\alpha \subseteq J_0$. Then we can show that $\alpha \in J_0$.
         
         \begin{myIndent}\exPP
            Case 1: $\alpha$ has an immediate predecessor $\beta$.
            
            \begin{myIndent}
               Then $S_\alpha = S_\beta \cup \{\beta\}$, meaning that:
   
               {\centering $h(\alpha) = h(S_\beta) \cup \{h(\beta)\} = S_{h(\beta)} \cup h(\beta)$.\retTwo\par}
               
               Since $h(\alpha)$ is the least element of $E$ not in $h(S_\alpha)$. We can thus say that $S_{h(\beta)} \cup h(\beta) = S_{h(\alpha)}$.\retTwo
            \end{myIndent}

            Case 2: $\alpha$ has no immediate predecessor.

            \begin{myIndent}
               Then we have that $h(S_\alpha) = h(\hspace{-0.2em}\bigcup\limits_{\beta \in S_\alpha}\hspace{-0.4em}S_\beta) = \hspace{-0.2em}\bigcup\limits_{\beta \in S_\alpha}\hspace{-0.4em}h(S_\beta) = \hspace{-0.2em}\bigcup\limits_{\beta \in S_\alpha}\hspace{-0.4em}S_{h(\beta)}$.\retTwo

               Hence, $h(S_\alpha)$ is a section of $E$, and since $h(\alpha)$ is the least element not in that section, we can conclude that $h(S_\alpha) = S_{h(\alpha)}$.\retTwo
            \end{myIndent}
         \end{myIndent}

         By transfinite induction, we thus know that $J_0 = J$. So finally, we consider two cases.\retTwo

         \begin{myIndent}\exPP
            Case 1: $J$ has a max element $\alpha$.
            
            \begin{myIndent}
               Then $h(J) = h(S_\alpha) \cup \{h(\alpha)\} = S_{h(\alpha)} \cup \{h(\alpha)\}$. And since $h(\alpha)$ is the least element not in $S_{h(\alpha)}$, we thus know that $h(J)$ is either a section of or the whole of $E$.
            \end{myIndent}

            Case 2: $J$ has no max element.

            \begin{myIndent}
               Then $h(J) = h(\hspace{-0.1em}\bigcup\limits_{\alpha \in J}\hspace{-0.3em}S_\alpha) = \hspace{-0.1em}\bigcup\limits_{\alpha \in J}\hspace{-0.3em}h(S_\alpha) = \hspace{-0.1em}\bigcup\limits_{\alpha \in J}\hspace{-0.3em}S_{h(\alpha)}$.\retTwo
               
               So, $h(J)$ is either a section of or the whole of $E$.\retTwo
            \end{myIndent}
         \end{myIndent}
      \end{myIndent}
   \end{enumerate}

   \item[(b)] If $E$ is a well-ordered set, show that no section of $E$ has the same order type as $E$, nor do any two different sections of $E$ have the same order type.
   
   
   \begin{myIndent}\exTwo\color{RedViolet}
      Let $J$ be any well-ordered set. By combining part (a) of this exercise with\\ exercise 10.10 (which is a special case of the general principle of recursive\\ definition), we know that there is at most one order preserving map from $J$\\ to $E$ whose image is either $E$ or a section of $E$. Hence, $J$ can only have the\\ same order type as one of either the entirity of $E$ or one section of $E$.\retTwo

      Based on that fact, we can get an easy contradiction if we assume that the claim of part (b) is false.
