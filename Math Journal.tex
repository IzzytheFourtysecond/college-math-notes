   My goal for today is to work through the appendix to chapter 1 in Baby Rudin. This appendix focuses on constructing the real numbers using Dedikind cuts.\retTwo
   
   \hTwo
   \begin{myIndent}
      We define a \udefine{cut} to be a set $\alpha \subset \mathbb{Q}$ such that:
      \begin{enumerate}
         \item $\alpha \neq \emptyset$
         \item If $p \in \alpha$,\myHS $q \in \mathbb{Q}$, and $q < p$, then $q \in \alpha$.
         \item If $p \in \alpha$, then $p < r$ for some $r \in \alpha$\newline
      \end{enumerate}

      Point 3 tells us that $\alpha$ doesn't have a max element. Also, point 2 directly implies the following facts:
      \begin{itemize}
         \item[a.] If $p \in \alpha$,\myHS $q \in \mathbb{Q}$, and $q \notin \alpha$, then $q > p$.
         \item[b.] If $r \notin \alpha$,\myHS $r, s \in \mathbb{Q}$, and $r < s$, then $s \notin \alpha$.\newline
      \end{itemize}

      As a shorthand, I shall refer to the set of all cuts as $R$.
      \begin{myIndent}\myComment
         An example of a cut would be the set of rational numbers less than $2$.\\
      \end{myIndent}

      Firstly, we shall assign an ordering to $R$. Specifically, given any $\alpha, \beta \in R$, we say that $\alpha < \beta$ if $\alpha \subset \beta$ (a proper subset).

      \begin{myIndent}\exTwo
         Here we prove that $<$ satisfies the definition of an ordering.
         \begin{itemize}
            \item[\mRoman{1}.] It's obvious from the definition of a proper subset that at most one of the following three things can be true: $\alpha < \beta$,\myHS $\alpha = \beta$, and $\beta < \alpha$.\retTwo
            
            Now let's assume that $a \not< \beta$ and $\alpha \not= \beta$. Then $\exists p \in \alpha$ such that $p \notin \beta$. But then for any $q \in \beta$, we must have by fact b. above that $q < p$. Hence $q \in \alpha$, meaning that $\beta \subset \alpha$. This proves that at least one of the following has to be true: $\alpha < \beta$,\myHS $\alpha = \beta$, and $\beta < \alpha$.\retTwo

            \item[\mRoman{2}.] If for $\alpha, \beta, \gamma \in R$ we have that $\alpha < \beta$ and $\beta < \gamma$, then clearly $\alpha < \gamma$ becuase $\alpha \subset \beta \subset \gamma$.\retTwo
         \end{itemize}
      \end{myIndent}

      Now we claim that $R$ equipped with $<$ has the least-upper-bound property.
      \begin{myIndent}\exTwo
         Proof:\\
         Let $A \subset R$ be nonempty and $\beta \in R$ be an upper bound of $A$. Then set\\ $\gamma = \hspace{-0.2em}\bigcup\limits_{\alpha \in A}\hspace{-0.2em}\alpha$. Firstly, we want to show that $\gamma \in R$\retTwo

         Since $A \neq \emptyset$, there exists $\alpha_0 \in A$. And as $\alpha_0 \neq \emptyset$ and $\alpha_0 \subseteq \gamma$ by definition, we know that $\gamma \neq \emptyset$. At the same time, we know that $\gamma \subset \beta$ since $\forall \alpha \in A$,\myHS $\alpha \subset \beta$. Hence, $\gamma \neq \mathbb{Q}$, meaning that $\gamma$ satisfies property 1$.$ of cuts.\retTwo

         Next, let $p \in \gamma$ and $q \in \mathbb{Q}$ such that $q < p$. We know that for some $\alpha_1 \in A$, we have that $p \in \alpha_1$. Hence by property 2$.$ of cuts, we know that $q \in \alpha_1 \subset \gamma$, thus showing that $\gamma$ satisfies property 2$.$ of cuts.\newpage
         
         Thirdly, by property 3$.$ we can pick $r \in \alpha_1$ such that $p < r$ and $r \in \alpha_1 \subset \gamma$. So, $\gamma$ satisfies property 3$.$ of cuts.\retTwo

         With that, we've now shown that $\gamma \in R$. Clearly, $\gamma$ is an upper bound of $A$ since $\alpha \subset \gamma$ for all $\alpha \in A$. Meanwhile, consider any $\delta < \gamma$. Then $\exists s \in \gamma$ such that $s \notin \delta$. And since $s \in \gamma$, we know that $s \in \alpha$ for some $\alpha \in A$. Hence, $\delta < \alpha$, meaning that $\delta$ is not an upper bound of $A$. This shows that $\gamma = \sup A$.\\ [6pt]
      \end{myIndent}

      Secondly, we want to assign $+$ and $\hspace{0.1em}\cdot\hspace{0.1em}$ operations to $R$ so that $R$ is an ordered field.\retTwo
      
      To start, given any $\alpha, \beta \in R$, we shall define $\alpha + \beta$ to be the set of all sums $r + s$ such that $r \in \alpha$ and $s \in \beta$.
      \begin{myIndent}\exTwo
         Here we show that $\alpha + \beta \in R$.
         \begin{enumerate}
            \item Clearly, $\alpha + \beta \neq \emptyset$. Also, take $r^\prime \notin \alpha$ and $s^\prime \notin \beta$. Then $r^\prime + s^\prime > r + s$ for all $r \in \alpha$ and $s \in \beta$. Hence, $r^\prime + s^\prime \notin \alpha + \beta$, meaning that $\alpha + \beta \neq \mathbb{Q}$.\\ [-9pt]
         \end{enumerate}

         Now let $p \in \alpha + \beta$. Thus there exists $r \in \alpha$ and $s \in \beta$ such that $p = r + s$.\\ [-9pt]

         \begin{enumerate}
            \item[2.] Suppose $q < p$. Then $q - s < r$, meaning that $q - s \in \alpha$. Hence,\\ $q = (q - s) + s \in \alpha + \beta$.\retTwo
            
            \item[3.] Let $t \in \alpha$ so that $t > r$. Then $p = r + s < t + s$ and $t + s \in \alpha + \beta$.\retTwo
         \end{enumerate}
      \end{myIndent}

      Also, we shall define $0^*$ to be the set of all negative rational numbers. Clearly, $0^*$ is a cut. Furthermore, we claim that $+$ satisfies the addition requirements of a field with $0^*$ as its $0$ element.

      \begin{myIndent}\exTwo
         Commutativity and associativity of $+$ on $R$ follows directly from the\\ commutativity and associativity of addition on the rational numbers.\retTwo

         Also, for any $\alpha \in R$,\myHS $\alpha + 0^* = \alpha$.
         \begin{myIndent}\exP
            If $r \in \alpha$ and $s \in 0^*$, then $r + s < r$. Hence $r + s \in \alpha$, meaning that $\alpha + 0^* \subseteq \alpha$. Meanwhile, if $p \in \alpha$, then we can pick $r \in \alpha$ such that $r > p$. Then, $p - r \in 0^*$ and $p = r + (p - r) \in \alpha + 0^*$. So, $\alpha \subseteq \alpha + 0^*$.\retTwo
         \end{myIndent}

         Finally, given any $\alpha \in R$, let $\beta = \{p \in \mathbb{Q} \mid \exists\hspace{0.1em} r \in \mathbb{Q}^+ \suchthat -p-r \notin \alpha\}$.
         \begin{myIndent}\myComment
            To give some intuition on this definition, firstly we want to guarentee that for all $p \in \beta$, $-p$ is greater than all elements of $\alpha$. Secondly, we add the $-r$ term to guarentee that $\beta$ doesn't have a maximum element.\\
         \end{myIndent}

         We claim that $\beta \in R$ and $\beta + \alpha = 0^*$. Hence, we can define $-\alpha = \beta$.

         \begin{myIndent}\exP
            To start, we'll show that $\beta \in R$:
            \begin{enumerate}
               \item For $s \notin \alpha$ and $p = -s - 1$, we have that $-p - 1 \notin \alpha$. Hence, $p \in \beta$, meaning that $\beta \neq \emptyset$. Meanwhile, if $q \in \alpha$, then $-q \notin \beta$ because there does not exist $r > 0$ such that $-(-q) - r = q - r \notin \alpha$. So $\beta \neq \mathbb{Q}$.\\ [-6pt]
            \end{enumerate}

            Now let $p \in \beta$ and pick $r > 0$ such that $-p -r \notin \alpha$.\newpage

            \begin{enumerate}
               \item[2.] Suppose $q < p$. Then $-q - r > -p - r$, meaning that $-q - r \notin \alpha$. Hence, $q \in \beta$.\retTwo
               
               \item[3.] Let $t = p + \frac{r}{2}$. Then $t > p$ and $-t - \frac{r}{2} = -p - r \notin \alpha$, meaning $t \in \beta$.\retTwo
            \end{enumerate}

            Now that we've proved $\beta \in R$, we next prove that $\beta$ is the additive inverse of $\alpha$. To start, suppose $r \in \alpha$ and $s \in \beta$. Then $-s \notin \alpha$, meaning that $r < -s$. So $r + s < 0$, thus showing that $\alpha + \beta \subseteq 0^*$.\retTwo

            As for the other inclusion, pick any $v \in 0^*$ and set $w = -\frac{v}{2}$. Then because $w > 0$, we can use the archimedean property of $\mathbb{Q}$ to say that there exists $n \in \mathbb{Z}$ such that $nw \in \alpha$ but $(n+1)w \notin \alpha$. Put $p = -(n + 2)w$. Then $p \in \beta$ because $-p - w = (n+1)w
            \notin \alpha$. And finally, $v = nw + p \in \alpha + \beta$. Thus, $0^* \subseteq \alpha + \beta$.\retTwo
         \end{myIndent}
      \end{myIndent}
   \end{myIndent}
   \dispDate{9/1/2024}
   \begin{myIndent}\hTwo
      Based on the definition of $+$, it's also hopefully clear that for any $\alpha, \beta, \gamma \in R$ such that $\alpha < \beta$, we have that $\alpha + \gamma < \beta + \gamma$.\retTwo

      Next, we shall define multiplication on $R$. Except, first we're going to limit ourselves to the set $R^+$ of all cuts greater than $0^*$. So, given any $\alpha, \beta \in R^+$, we shall define $\alpha \beta$ to be the set of all $p \in \mathbb{Q}$ such that $p \leq rs$ where $r \in \alpha$,\myHS $s \in \beta$,\myHS $r > 0$, and $s > 0$.

      \begin{myIndent}\exTwo
         Here we show that $\alpha\beta \in R^+$.
         \begin{enumerate}
            \item Clearly $\alpha\beta \neq \emptyset$. Also, take any $r^\prime \notin \alpha$ and $s^\prime \notin \beta$. Then $r^\prime s^\prime > rs$ for all $r \in \alpha \cap \mathbb{Q}^+$ and $s \in \beta \cap \mathbb{Q}^+$ since all four rational numbers are positive. By extension, $r^\prime s^\prime$ is greater than all the elements (both positive and negative) of $\alpha\beta$. So, $r^\prime s^\prime \notin \alpha\beta$, meaning that $\alpha\beta \neq \mathbb{Q}$.\\ [-9pt]
         \end{enumerate}

         Now let $p \in \alpha\beta$. Based on our definition of $\alpha\beta$, we know that the conditions of a cut trivially hold for any negative $p$. So, we'll assume from now on that $p > 0$. (Also note that a positive choice of $p$ must exist because both $\alpha$ and $\beta$ by assumption have positive elements.)\retTwo

         Since $p \in \alpha\beta \cap \mathbb{Q}^+$, we know there exists $r \in \alpha$ and $s \in \beta$ such that $p = rs$ and $r, s > 0$.

         \begin{enumerate}
            \item[2.] Suppose $0 < q < p$ (the case where $q \leq 0$ is trivial). Then $\frac{q}{s} < r$, meaning that $\frac{q}{s} \in \alpha$. So, $q = \frac{q}{s} \cdot s \in \alpha\beta$.\retTwo
            
            \item[3.] Let $t \in \alpha$ so that $t > r$. Then $p = rs < ts$ and $ts \in \alpha\beta$.\retTwo
         \end{enumerate}
      \end{myIndent}

      Also, we shall define $1^*$ to be the set of all rational numbers less than $1$. Clearly, $1^*$ is a cut. And we claim that $\hspace{0.1em}\cdot\hspace{0.1em}$ satisfies the multiplication requirements of a field with $1^*$ as its $1$ element.\newpage

      \begin{myIndent}\exTwo
         As before, commutativity and associativity of $\hspace{0.1em}\cdot\hspace{0.1em}$ on $R^+$ follows directly from commutativity and associativity of multiplication on the rational numbers.\retTwo

         Next, for any $\alpha \in R^+$, we have that $\alpha 1^* = \alpha$.
         \begin{myIndent}\exP
            It's clear that for any rational number $r \leq 0$, we have that $r \in \alpha 1^*$ and $r \in \alpha$. So we can exclusively focus on positive rational numbers.\retTwo
            
            Now suppose $r \in \alpha \cap \mathbb{Q}^+$ and $s \in 1^*$. Then $rs < r$, meaning that $rs \in \alpha$. So $\alpha 1^* \subseteq \alpha$. Meanwhile, if $p \in \alpha \cap \mathbb{Q}^+$, then we can pick $r \in \alpha$ such that $r > p$. Then $\frac{p}{r} \in 1^*$ and $p = \frac{p}{r} \cdot r \in \alpha 1^*$. So, $\alpha \subseteq \alpha 1^*$.\retTwo
         \end{myIndent}

         Thirdly, given any $\alpha \in R^+$, define:

         \begin{centering}
            $\beta = \{p \in \mathbb{Q} \mid p \leq 0\} \cup \{p \in \mathbb{Q}^+ \mid \exists r \in \mathbb{Q}^+ \suchthat \frac{1}{q} - r \notin \alpha\}$\retTwo\par
         \end{centering}

         \begin{myIndent}\exP
            Here we show that $\beta \in R^+$.
            \begin{enumerate}
               \item Clearly $\beta \neq \emptyset$. Also, if $q \in \alpha$, then $\frac{1}{q} \notin \beta$. Hence, $\beta \neq \mathbb{Q}$.\retTwo
            \end{enumerate}

            Now let $p \in \beta$ and pick $r > 0$ such that $\frac{1}{p} - r \notin \alpha$. Also, assume $p > 0$ because the proof is trivial if $p \leq 0$. (The fact that $p > 0$ in $\beta$ exists is trivial to show.)\retTwo

            \begin{enumerate}
               \item[2.] If $q \leq 0 < p$, then trivially $q \in \beta$. Meanwhile, if $0 < q < p$, then\\ [2pt] $\frac{1}{q} - r > \frac{1}{p} - r$, meaning that $\frac{1}{q} - r \notin \alpha$. Hence, $q \notin \beta$.\retTwo
               
               \item[3.] Let $t = \frac{1}{\frac{1}{p} - \frac{r}{2}}$. Then since $\frac{1}{p} - r \notin \alpha$, we know that $\frac{1}{p} - \frac{r}{2} > 0$. Also since $\frac{1}{t} = \frac{1}{p} - \frac{r}{2} < \frac{1}{p}$, we have that $t > p$. But note that $\frac{1}{t} - \frac{r}{2} = \frac{1}{p} - r \notin \alpha$.\\[2pt] Hence $t \notin \beta$.\retTwo
            \end{enumerate}
         \end{myIndent}

         We claim that $\beta\alpha = 1^*$. Hence, we can define $\frac{1}{\alpha} = \beta$.

         \begin{myIndent}\exP
            To start, suppose $r \in \alpha \cap \mathbb{Q}^+$ and $s \in \beta \cap \mathbb{Q}^+$. Then $\frac{1}{s} \notin \alpha$, meaning that\\ $r < \frac{1}{s}$. So $rs < 1$, thus showing that $\alpha\beta \subseteq 1^*$.\retTwo

            The other inclusion has a more complicated proof. Firstly, take any\\ $v \in 1^* \cap \mathbb{Q}^+$ (the proof is trivial if $v \leq 0$). Then set $w = \frac{1}{v}$, meaning\\ that $w > 1$. Now since $\alpha \in R^+$, we know there exists $n \in \mathbb{Z}$ such that\\ $w^n \in \alpha$ but $w^{n+1} \notin \alpha$. Then as $w^{n+2} > w^{n+1}$, we know that $\frac{1}{w^{n+2}} \in \beta$.\\ Hence, $v^2 = w^n \frac{1}{w^{n+2}} \in \alpha\beta$.\retTwo

            Now that we've shown that the square of every $v \in 1^* \cap \mathbb{Q}^+$ is also in $\alpha\beta$,\\ [2pt] we next show that there exists $z \in 1^* \cap \mathbb{Q}^+$ such that $z^2 > v$. Suppose $v = \frac{p}{q}$ where $p, q \in \mathbb{Z}^+$. Then set $z = \frac{p + q}{2q}$. Importantly, since $p < q$, we still have that $z \in 1^*$. But also note that:

            \begin{centering}
               $z^2 - v = \frac{p^2 + 2pq + q^2}{4q^2} - \frac{4pq}{4q^2} = \frac{p^2 - 2pq + q^2}{4q^2} = \left(\frac{p - q}{2q}\right)^2 \geq 0$\retTwo\par
            \end{centering}

            Thus as $v < z^2$ and $z^2 \in \alpha\beta$, we have that $v \in \alpha\beta$ as well. So $1^* \subseteq \alpha\beta$.\newpage
         \end{myIndent}

         Finally, so long as $\alpha, \beta, \gamma \in R^+$, we have that  $\alpha(\beta + \gamma) = \alpha\beta + \alpha\gamma$ because the rational numbers satisfy the distributive property.\retTwo
      \end{myIndent}

      Notably, in proving that $\alpha\beta \in R^+$ before, we also guarenteed that for $\alpha, \beta > 0$, we have that $\alpha\beta > 0$.\retTwo

   \dispDate{9/7/2024}

   \begin{myIndent}

      Now we still need to extend our definition of multiplication from $R^+$ to all of $R$. To do this, set $\alpha 0^* = 0^*\alpha = 0^*$ and define:

      {\centering $\alpha \beta = \left\{
      \begin{matrix}
         (-\alpha)(-\beta) & \text{ if } \alpha < 0^*, \beta < 0^* \\
         -((-\alpha)\beta) & \text { if } \alpha < 0^*, \beta > 0^* \\
         -(\alpha(-\beta)) & \text{ if } \alpha > 0^*, \beta < 0^*
      \end{matrix}\right.$ \retTwo\par}

      Having done that, reproving those properties of multiplication on all of $R$ just\\ becomes a matter of addressing many cases and using the identity that\\ $(-(-\alpha)) = \alpha$.

      \begin{myIndent}\myComment
         Note that that identity can be proven just from the addition properties of a field.\retTwo
      \end{myIndent}

      Because I'm bored with this construction at this point, I'm going to skip reproving those properties.\retTwo

      So now that we've established that $R$ is a field, all we have left to do is to show that all numbers $r, s \in \mathbb{Q}$ are represented by cuts $r^*, s^* \in R$ such that:
      
      \begin{itemize}
         \item $(r + s)^* = r^* + s^*$
         \item $(rs)^* = r^*s^*$
         \item $r < s \Longleftrightarrow r^* < s^*$\retTwo
      \end{itemize}

      Again, I'm super bored and demotivated at this point. So, I'm going to skip showing this.\retTwo

      With all that done, we've now shown that $R$ satisfies all of the properties of real numbers. That concludes the proof of the existence theorem of the real numbers.

Then clearly $f$ is injective as\\ $\forall A, B \in \mathcal{P}(\mathbb{Z}_+)$, $f(A) = f(B) \Longrightarrow A = B$. Also, given any $\mathbf{x} \in X^\omega$, we\\ know that the set $A = \{i \in \mathbb{Z}_+ \mid \mathbf{x}_i = 1\}$ satisfies that $f(A) = \mathbf{x}$,\\ meaning $f$ is surjective.

      Now, the textbook recommends defining $h: A \longrightarrow B$ by:

            f(x) & & \text{ if } x \in A_n - B_n \text{ for any } n \in \mathbb{Z}_+ \\
            x & & \text{ otherwise }
         \end{matrix}\right.$\newpage
      \end{center}

      
      \begin{myIndent}
         \myComment I want to ask a professor about this definition because it urks me. My issue with\\ this definition of $h$ is that I feel like it should be possible for:
         $$\bigcap\limits_{n=1}^\infty (A_n \cap B_n) \neq \emptyset.$$
         
         However, we wouldn't be able to know that some $x$ is in that intersection and\\ thus falls into case 2 until after an infinite number of steps.\retTwo
         
         On the other hand, $S_1 = \bigcup\limits_{n = 1}^\infty (A_n - B_n)$ is a valid definition for a set, as is\\ $S_2 = A - S_1$. So the definition $h$ is valid because it's saying that $h(x) = f(x)$\\ [6pt] if $x \in S_1$ and $h(x) = x$ if $x \in S_2$.\retTwo

         Maybe my issue is just that I have trouble trusting the validity of a function definition if I can't actually evaluate that function myself. Although, there are lots of functions like that that I don't have any problem with. For example, given $g(x) = 0$ if $x$ is rational and $g(x) = 1$ if $x$ is irrational, what is $g(\pi^2)$?\retTwo
      \end{myIndent}

      Hopefully it is clear that $h$ is in fact a valid function from $A$ to $B$. Now firstly, we shall show that $h$ is injective.

      \begin{myIndent}\exP
         Let $x, y \in A$ such that $x \neq y$. If there are integers $n$ and $m$ such that $x \in A_n - B_n$ and $y \in A_m - B_m$, then $h(x) \neq h(y)$ because $f$ is injective. Meanwhile, if no such $n$ or $m$ exists, then $h(x) \neq h(y)$ because $x \neq y$.\retTwo

         This leaves the case that there exists $n \in \mathbb{Z}_+$ such that $x \in A_n - B_n$ but for\\ all $m \in \mathbb{Z}_+,\myHS y \notin A_m - B_m$. Then, note that $f(x) \in f(A_{n} - B_{n})$. And since\\ $f$ is injective, we thus have that $f(x) \in f(A_{n}) - f(B_{n}) = A_{n+1} - B_{n+1}$.\\ Therefore, as $y \notin A_{n+1} - B_{n+1}$, we know that $h(x) \neq y = h(y)$.\retTwo
      \end{myIndent}

      Next, we show $h$ is surjective.

      \begin{myIndent}\exP
         Let $y \in B$.\retTwo
         
         Suppose there exists $n \in \mathbb{Z}_+$ such that $y \in A_n - B_n$. We know that $n \neq 1$ since $y \in B$. Thus, there must exist $x \in A_{n-1}$ such that $y = f(x) \in f(A_{n-1}) = A_n$. Furthermore, this $x$ can't be in $B_{n-1}$ because otherwise $y$ would be in $B_n$ which we know isn't true. So, $x \in A_{n-1} - B_{n-1}$, meaning that $h(x) = f(x) = y$.\retTwo

         Meanwhile, if no such $n$ exists, then we simply have that $h(y) = y$. Hence,\\ $h(A) = B$.\retTwo
      \end{myIndent}

      Thus, we've shown that $h$ is a bijection, meaning that $|A| = |B|$.\newpage

   \blab{Exercise 7.7:} Show that $|\{0, 1\}^\omega| = |(\mathbb{Z}_+)^\omega|$.

   
   \begin{myIndent}\exTwo
      Firstly, there's obviously a bijection exists between $\{0, 1\}^\omega$ and $\{1, 2\}^\omega$. Also,\\ $\{1, 2\}^\omega \subset (\mathbb{Z}_+)^\omega$. So, if we can construct an injective function from $(\mathbb{Z}_+)^\omega$ to\\ $\{1, 2\}^\omega$, then we can apply the result of exercise 7.6.a to prove this exercise's\\ claim.\retTwo

      We shall create this injection using a diagonalization argument. Let $x \in (\mathbb{Z}_+)^\omega$.\\ Then we define $f(x) = y \in \{1, 2\}^\omega$ as follows:
      
      \begin{center}
         \begin{tabular}{c}
            $y(1) = 2$ if $x(1) = 1$. Otherwise $y(1) = 1$.\\ [6pt]
            $y(2) = 2$ if $x(1) = 2$. Otherwise $y(2) = 1$.\\
            $y(3) = 2$ if $x(2) = 1$. Otherwise $y(3) = 1$.\\ [6pt]
            $y(4) = 2$ if $x(1) = 3$. Otherwise $y(4) = 1$.\\
            $y(5) = 2$ if $x(2) = 2$. Otherwise $y(5) = 1$.\\
            $y(6) = 2$ if $x(3) = 1$. Otherwise $y(6) = 1$. \\ [6pt]

         We know $i \neq 1$ because $f(1) = a_0 = g(1)$. But then note that\\ $f|_{\{1, \ldots, i - 1\}} = g|_{\{1, \ldots, i- 1\}}$. Hence:

      A few notes:
      \begin{enumerate}
         \item If we restrict $\mathcal{A}$ to being a finite collection, then there is nothing controversial about this axiom. It only becomes controversial when $\mathcal{A}$ is allowed to be infinite.
         \item There are multiple instances in baby Rudin where we made an infinite number of\\ arbitrary choices. Looking at a lot of those proofs closer, I think many of them could avoid using the axiom of choice by specifying that we had to pick rational numbers in a set. However, being able to pick elements without worrying about a preexisting choice function is way easier.\retTwo

   \begin{myIndent}\hTwo
      Proof:\\
      Given any set $B \in \mathcal{B}$, we define $B^\prime = \{(B, b) \mid b \in B\}$. Because $B \neq \emptyset$, we know that $B^\prime \neq \emptyset$ as well. Furthermore, given $B_1, B_2 \in \mathcal{B}$ if $B_1 \neq B_2$, then we have that the first element of all the pairs in $B_1^\prime$ are different from that of $B_2^\prime$. So $B_1^\prime$ and $B_2^\prime$ are disjoint.\retTwo

      Now form the collection $\mathcal{C} = \{B^\prime \mid B \in \mathcal{B}\}$. From before, we know that $\mathcal{C}$ is\\ a collection of disjoint sets. So by the axiom of choice, there exists a set $c$\\ consisting of exactly one element from each element of $\mathcal{C}$.\retTwo

         Now given any $k \geq 1$, if $k \in R$, we know that $\{1, \ldots, k\}$ must be a subset of $R$. Also note that $R \cap S = \emptyset$ because if that wasn't true, we'd know that $S$ has a least element. Therefore, $\{1, \ldots, k\} \cap S = \emptyset$. But then that shows that $k + 1 \notin S$ since otherwise $k + 1$ would be the least element of $S$. Furthermore, since no element of $\{1, \ldots, k\}$ is in $S$, we automatically have that $k + 1 \in R$.\retTwo

         Let $S$ be a subset of $\mathbb{Z}_+$ such that $1 \in S$ and $k \in S \Longrightarrow k + 1 \in S$. Then suppose that $S \neq \mathbb{Z}_+$. In that case, we know that $S^\comp \neq \emptyset$, and since $\mathbb{Z}_+$ is well-ordered, we know there is a least element $\alpha$ of $S^\comp$.\retTwo

         Because $1 \in S$, we know that $\alpha \geq 2$. But then consider that $1 \leq \alpha - 1 < \alpha$. Therefore, $\alpha - 1 \in S$, thus implying that $\alpha \in S$. This contradicts that $\alpha \in S^\comp$.\retTwo

      From what I've heard, when defining the positive integers, one usally takes one of the two above properties as an axiom and then proves the other as a theorem. In Munkres' book, he starts with induction and proves well-orderedness.\retTwo\retTwo

   Facts:
   \begin{itemize}
      \item If $A$ with the order relation $<$ is well-ordered, then any subset of $A$ is well-\\ordered as well with $<$ restricted to that subset.
      \item If $A$ has the order relation $<_1$ and $B$ has the order relation $<_2$ and both are well-ordered, then $A \times B$ is well-ordered with the dictionary order.
      \item Given any countable set $A$, we know there exists a bijection $f$ from $A$ to $\mathbb{Z}_+$. Hence, given $a, b \in A$, we can say that $a < b \Longleftrightarrow f(a) < f(b)$. Then, $A$ is well-ordered by $<$ with the least element of any subset $S$ of $A$ being the element $\alpha \in A$ such that $f(\alpha)$ is the least element in $f(S)$.
      \item If a set $A$ is well-ordered, then we can make a choice function $c: \mathcal{P}(A) \longrightarrow A$ using that well-ordering.
      
      \begin{myIndent}
         Specifically, given any $B \subseteq A$, assign $c(B) = \beta$ where $\beta$\\ is the least element of $B$.

            This is why we can pick elements of $\mathbb{Q}$ without worrying about the axiom of choice.\retTwo\retTwo

   An important theorem (which I will hopefully prove soon) is:
   
   \begin{myIndent}
      \blab{The Well Ordering Theorem:} If $A$ is a set, there exists an order relation on $A$ that is well-ordering.\retTwo
   \end{myIndent}

   \exOne\blab{Exercise 10.5:} Show that the well-ordering theorem implies the (infinite) axiom of choice.
   \begin{myIndent}\exTwo
      Let $\mathcal{A}$ be a collection of disjoint sets. By the well-ordering theorem, we can pick an order relation on $\bigcup\limits_{A \in \mathcal{A}}A$ that is well-ordering.\newpage
      
      \begin{myIndent}\myComment
         Note that the previous sentence is carefully worded to only make use of the finite axiom of choice. Specifically, the order relation we are picking is an element of some subset of $\bigcup\limits_{A \in \mathcal{A}}A \times \bigcup\limits_{A \in \mathcal{A}}A$.\retTwo

         If we had instead picked a well-ordering for each $A \in \mathcal{A}$, then that would require the axiom of choice as we would be making potentially infinitely many arbitrary choices of order relations.\retTwo
      \end{myIndent}

      Now let $C = \{a \in \hspace{-0.2em}\bigcup\limits_{A \in \mathcal{A}}\hspace{-0.2em}A \mid \exists A \in \mathcal{A} \suchthat a \in A \text{ and } \forall b \in A,\myHS a \leq b \}$.\retTwo Then $C$ fulfils the properties of the set that the axiom of choice would guarentee exists.
